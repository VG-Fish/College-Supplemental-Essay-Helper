The Senses.
Our senses help us experience the world around us.
 Harvard researchers are working to understand, improve, and replicate these sensory organs.
.
The ins and outs.
The act of sensing starts with stimulus from the world, which triggers a physiological response, which is combined with previous experiences, which results in an internal representation, which is our brain’s best guess at what’s going on around us.

For Sophomores.
Sophomore year is an exciting time, as you begin to identify your academic interests and find an academic home at Harvard.
.
Many of the life sciences concentrations offer portal courses for fall semester sophomores; these courses introduce concepts and ways of thinking that are fundamental to each concentration.
 Therefore, you should think carefully about your potential concentration before the fall semester begins.
  Based on your potential concentration, you may also wish to enroll in courses in related fields, such as mathematics, chemistry, or statistics.
  For guidance with concentration and course selection, we encourage you to talk with a life sciences advisor before start of the fall semester.
.
Students declare a concentration in November of the sophomore year.
  In preparation for this, you will develop a four-year plan of study that lists the courses you intend to take during your time at Harvard.
  The life sciences advisors will work with you to craft a plan of study that best suits your interests.
  We encourage you to make an appointment to talk with an advisor early in the fall, rather than waiting for the concentration declaration deadline.
.
Additional Resources of Interest:.
We recommend that you take a look at the.
Life Sciences Advising Booklet.

The Life Sciences Experience.
Harvard does not have a single concentration (the Harvard word for major) in biology.
 Rather, we have a cluster of nine related concentrations in the life sciences.
  These nine concentrations span seven academic departments.
  Depending on your interests, you might choose a more quantitative approach, or you might integrate courses from the social sciences with your study of biology.
  Overall, life sciences education at Harvard has a distinctly interdisciplinary focus.
.
When you first enter Harvard, you do not need to know exactly what you wish to study; you have until November of your sophomore year to declare a concentration.
  Freshmen interested in the life sciences typically take a set of interdisciplinary foundational courses, and sophomores usually enroll in courses that serve as portals into the various concentrations.
  As students continue, they begin to specialize in distinct areas of the life sciences.
  If your interests change, we will help you move between concentrations to find the best match for you.
  Even if you choose not to concentrate in the life sciences, there are many ways to engage in research and coursework in the life sciences.
.
Home to a vast array of cutting-edge research, Harvard University is an exciting place to study science.
  Students are encouraged to pursue original research with a faculty member, and undergraduates can choose from labs not just at the Cambridge campus, but also at any of the affiliated hospitals – with well over one thousand research groups in the life sciences.
  In classes and tutorials, students have the opportunity to learn from faculty about the process of science and about recent breakthroughs.

Careers in the Life Sciences.
When we have asked life sciences concentrators what they have done after graduating, the answer is almost everything.
  The skills that you learn as a life sciences concentrator – such as critical thinking and communication skills – are transferable to almost any profession.
.
Many students who graduate with a degree in the life sciences proceed to further education, including graduate school or medical school.
.
Graduate school in the sciences:  Pursuing an advanced degree in the sciences (a Ph.
D.
 or a Master’s degree) involves studying particular scientific topics in depth and undertaking an original research project that spans many years.
  Many people who complete a Ph.
D.
 choose a career path that involves research and/or teaching.
   However, the options are limitless.
 For example, careers for Ph.
D.
-level scientists include science journalism and patent law.
.
Medical school or other health professional school (e.
g.
 veterinary school, dental school):  Concentrating in the life sciences is a natural choice for some students who are passionate about medicine and the workings of the human body.
  The requirements of all of the life sciences concentrations overlap with the courses that are required for admission to medical school.
  However, it is not necessary to concentrate in the life sciences in order to attend medical school; one third of medical school applicants from Harvard choose a concentration outside of the sciences.
.
Joint degrees:  Many graduate programs allow you to combine your varied interests through joint degree programs, including degrees in medicine and research, medicine and public health, medicine and law, or medicine and business.
.
Students who concentrate in the life sciences are well prepared to pursue a range of professions.
  As examples, life sciences concentrators have pursued careers in:.
Business.
Consulting.
Environmental advocacy.
Law.
Public health.
Public policy and government.
Research – either in an academic setting or at a biotech company.
Social work or counseling.
Software engineering and IT.
Science museums.
Science writing.
Teaching.

Life Sciences Concentrations Descriptions.
Biomedical Engineering.
Biomedical engineering.
lies at the intersection of the physical and life sciences, incorporating principles from physics and chemistry to understand the operation of living systems.
 As in other engineering fields, the approach is highly quantitative: mathematical analysis and modeling are used to capture the function of systems from subcellular to organism scales.
 An education in Biomedical Engineering, and engineering more broadly, enables students to translate abstract hypotheses and scientific knowledge into working systems (e.
g.
, prosthetic devices, imaging systems, and biopharmaceuticals).
 This enables one to both test the understanding of basic principles and to further this knowledge, and it places this understanding in the broader context of societal needs.
.
Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB).
The Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB).
concentration emphasizes a quantitative approach to the life sciences that involves using tools, approaches and methodologies from mathematics, chemistry, and physics to study biology.
 It is ideally suited for students who are interested in applying the knowledge they gain in higher-level coursework work in mathematics, chemistry, and physics to current research in the Life Sciences.
.
Chemistry.
Chemistry.
is both a basic science, fundamental to an understanding of the world we live in, and a practical science with an enormous number and variety of important applications.
  Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an understanding of biology and biochemistry and of certain aspects of geology, astronomy, physics, and engineering.
.
Cognitive Neuroscience & Evolutionary Psychology (CN&EP).
Cognitive Neuroscience & Evolutionary Psychology (CN&EP).
is.
one.
of the specialized tracks.
within the Psychology concentration.
and part of the Life Sciences cluster of concentration options.
 As such, it is one of the major paths toward bridging the social and Life Sciences at Harvard.
 The track reflects the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of learning and research in psychology, emphasizing integration across the sub-disciplines within psychology (social psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, abnormal psychology) as well as connections between psychology and the other Life Sciences.
 Students in this track have the opportunity to study the interplay between traditional interests in psychology such as vision, memory, language, emotion, intergroup relations, and psychological disorders, and recent developments in neuroscience and evolutionary science.
.
Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB).
Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB).
is a concentration that educates students on how human beings develop from a fertilized egg, are maintained and repaired throughout adulthood, and age till life’s end.
 Students receive a broad education in modern life sciences by studying important biological principles within the specific rubric of the developing and regenerating body.
 By including an explicit and heavy emphasis on hands-on research opportunities in all four undergraduate years, HDRB engages students with an interest in research and takes advantage of Harvard’s special strengths as a teaching college and research university.
.
Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB).
Evolutionary theory is a pillar of modern science and provides a powerful framework for investigating questions about why humans are the way they are.
 Human evolutionary biologists seek to understand how evolutionary forces have shaped our design, our physiology, and our patterns of behavior.
 Research in.
human evolutionary biology.
profoundly influences medical science and the practice of medicine, and also impacts economics, psychology, political science, religion and literature.
.
Integrative Biology (IB)/Organismic & Evolutionary Biology (OEB).
Integrative Biology (IB)/Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB).
takes as its guiding principle the maxim that "nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution.
"  Evolution is the strand that ties together all of biology: from the adaptive specifics of a membrane pore to grand events in the history of life, such as the Cambrian Explosion, when, 540 million years ago, life went in a single bound from simple to complex.
 IB is inherently inter-disciplinary, encompassing mathematical and computational biology, functional and genetic approaches to morphology and development, as well as genetics, evolution, and ecology.
.
Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB).
Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB).
concentrators are interested in understanding the intersection of modern research in cellular biology with medicine and society.
 MCB is therefore ideally suited for students who wish to study cellular processes at the heart of both normal physiology and molecular medicine.
 It focuses on fundamental principles of modern biology at the hub of nearly all life science sub-disciplines, and integrates many different methodologies ranging from chemistry and genetics to computer science and engineering, as well as fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics.
.
Neuroscience.
In.
Neuroscience.
(NEURO), students investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior as well as how brains process information.
 We study the nervous system at every level: from the macroscopic (behavior and cognition) to the microscopic (cells and molecules).
 The NEURO concentration showcases the science of how the nervous system organizes behavior.
 Concentrators investigate phenomena on vastly different scales, from molecules to societies, and draw upon many of the classical disciplines for experimental tools and explanatory frameworks.
.
Consequently, the questions that neuroscientists ask are wide-ranging: how do electrical and molecular signals allow neurons to process and transmit information from the environment? What guides the development of the immense number of precise connections in the nervous system? How can the complex signals of many thousands of active neurons be recorded and interpreted? What causes the profound behavioral deficits in Alzheimers disease or Autism Spectrum Disorders?.

Chemical and Physical Biology.
The Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB) concentration provides students with a broad foundation in the physical and life sciences.
 This concentration is designed for students interested in applying quantitative tools, physical concepts, and chemical principles to the study of biology.
.
Remarkable progress in the last four decades has revealed the atomic structure of proteins, enzymes, and genes; the nature of the genetic code; and how genes can be turned on or off in response to the demands of the environment.
 As our understanding of fundamental biological processes has increased, so has our appreciation that the focus on information transfer through nucleic acids provides an inadequate basis for understanding living systems.
 The activities of proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications—chemical changes in protein structure—and are affected by small signaling molecules.
 Dissecting metabolic pathways and reconstructing cellular networks requires supplementing the traditional arsenal of molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological techniques with advances in chemical and physical methods that make it possible to characterize the state of a biological system under a given set of conditions.
 Chemical and physical biology provides a link between classical approaches to studying biology and the chemical tools and physical methods required to understand dynamic changes in complex biological systems.
.
Students who are interested in understanding living systems in detail will require considerable proficiency in mathematics and physics as well as a broad background in both chemistry and biology.
 In its emphasis on quantitative, physical, and chemical tools, this concentration represents a significant departure from traditional undergraduate programs of study in the biological and life sciences.
 Our goal is to provide the next generation of life scientists with the background needed to make new advances in the quantitative understanding of living systems.
.
All students are required to participate in a tutorial unless engaged in thesis research.
 Tutorials for students in both Chemical and Physical Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology are offered by the Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences, which was established in 1926.
 Each tutor holds a PhD and/or an MD degree and meets with her or his students, singly or in small groups, about twice a month to discuss topics tailored largely to individual interests and needs.
 Tutorial sessions typically consist of readings selected from the primary literature or relevant texts.
 Mentoring on career choices, the research experience, and other academic issues is a logical extension of the tutorial.
 The tutorial is not taken for credit and therefore does not appear on the study card or transcript.
.
View the CPB tutorial program handout.
to see the history, goals, and format of the tutorial program.
.
All students are required to obtain a minimum of one term of laboratory research experience.
 This requirement may be fulfilled through a project lab course, a term of laboratory research (CPB 91), or research for a senior thesis (CPB 99AB).
.
A thesis based on laboratory research is required to be eligible for honors in the Chemical and Physical Biology concentration.
 Students are encouraged to begin thesis research in a laboratory no later than the start of their junior year.

Human Evolutionary Biology.
Overview:.
Evolutionary theory provides a powerful framework for investigating why humans are the way we are.
 Human evolutionary biologists seek to understand how evolutionary forces have shaped our anatomy, physiology, psychology, culture and behavior.
 Research in human evolutionary biology influences many professions and social issues including medicine, politics, business, and gender and race relations.
.
Some of our key questions include:.
How does our gut microbiota influence patterns of disease?.
Why did our species evolve such large brains?.
How can health care be improved by understanding our species’ evolutionary history?.
Why do humans walk upright?.
What psychological, anatomical and physiological traits are uniquely human and why did they evolve?.
Why and how do humans cooperate on such large-scales compared to other primates?.
How has culture and its evolution--including things like music and religion--shaped our species’ biological evolution?.
How does the lifestyle of modern humans (e.
g.
, diet, activity levels) impact our evolutionary trajectory?.
Research:.
This is an exciting time to tackle questions of how evolution made us human.
 Research in HEB provides you the opportunity to learn and contribute.
 HEB faculty lead projects spanning a spectrum of interests and methods, including fieldwork studying diverse societies or African apes, laboratory-based work on endocrinology, genetics, comparative neuroscience, anatomy, the microbiota and nutrition, and computationally intensive projects on genomics and cultural evolution.

Thinking of concentrating in Integrative Bio?.
We'd love to have you join us!  Get in touch with concentration advisor.
Andrew Berry.
to set up a meeting, and we'll take it from there.
.
Integrative Bio's Class of '24 (well, *most* of '24).
Integrative Biology (IB), formerly known as Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB), embraces Biology as a whole, aiming to make sense of, and connect, the many different levels—molecular, cellular, genetic, developmental, anatomical, physiological, ecological, phylogenetic—at which biological systems are analyzed.
 In particular, the focus is on evolution, the historical process that ties together all of biology: from the adaptive consequences of a single amino acid substitution in a protein to grand events in the history of life, such as the Cambrian Explosion, when, 540 million years ago, animal life evolved rapidly from simple to complex.
 Adaptive evolution is a response to the demands of the environment, whether this is the environment within a cell or an ecological community of interacting organisms.
 Integrative Biology therefore is inherently inter-disciplinary, encompassing mathematical and computational biology, genetics, evolution, and ecology as well as functional and genetic approaches to morphology and development.
.
IB offers students opportunities for learning and for doing original research both in the lab and in the field, with, for example, courses every year taking students to the Tropics for fieldwork.
.
OEB 11, Introduction to Tropical Biology, Australia.
OEB faculty members’ research interests range from human health and disease to evolutionary theory, genomics and organismal biology and ecology.
  For more information, see faculty pages on the.
OEB departmental website.
.
.
Students who are considering IB as a concentration are encouraged to complete the three introductory courses (Life Sciences 1a, 1b, OEB 10) by the end of their sophomore year.
 From the firm foundation of a series of introductory courses, students explore one or more areas in depth by taking upper-level courses.
 Students are encouraged to follow their own interests through the concentration, but we have put together some "suggested pathways" (i.
e.
, suggested combinations of mid-level and upper-level courses) for perennially popular areas:.
Plant Sciences.
Marine Biology & Biological Oceanography.

Molecular and Cellular Biology.
Are you curious ….
how cells move?.
why we need to eat salt?.
what is “.
personalized medicine.
”?.
how cells build an eye?.
why drugs like thalidomide cause birth defects – and given they’re so dangerous, why we use them to treat cancer and leprosy?.
whether the bacteria in our guts tell us how to behave?.
how one searches through the DNA sequence from cells – all 3.
billion.
base pairs - to find a single mutation that causes cancer?.
why water doesn’t soak through our skin into our bodies when we shower?.
how our nerves perceive sunshine or chili peppers?.
The Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) concentration addresses these kinds of questions, and more.
 It explores how molecules drive the formation and function of cells and organs, and how those processes go awry in diseases like cancer or conditions like deafness.
 Students in MCB will acquire an understanding of scientific logic and approaches as they explore a wide range of contemporary subjects, spanning biochemistry, cell biology, genomics, systems biology, developmental biology, immunology, drug design, cancer biology, molecular medicine, the microbiome, global health and infectious disease.
 MCB is therefore ideally suited for students who wish to study molecular and cellular processes at the heart of modern biology and disease.
.
MCB encourages students to experience research first hand by joining the laboratory of a MCB-affiliated faculty member.
 This experience exposes concentrators to the thrills and challenges of scientific discovery at the cutting edge.
 We consider the senior thesis to be the capstone academic experience, and the concentration supports seniors to make thesis writing an enriching experience fun.
.
Students who graduate from the MCB concentration will be informed citizens who can understand and evaluate the impact of new research discoveries in the biological and biomedical sciences, discoveries that are unfolding at a breathtaking and accelerating pace.
 Graduates will stand poised to pursue a wide range of careers, including biological and medical research, public and global health, science policy, law and intellectual property, business, education, and science writing.

“Even before arriving at Harvard, I knew that I wanted to learn more about the human brain and behavior.
 People would ask me why, and all I could tell them was ‘the brain is just amazing’.
 Today, I completely stand by my response.
 The brain is amazing, but thanks to Harvard’s unique, informative, brilliantly organized neurobiology concentration, I can finally tell everyone exactly why.
”.
Neuro News.
In Neuroscience, students investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior as well as how brains process information.
 We study the nervous system at every level: from the macroscopic (behavior and cognition) to the microscopic (cells and molecules).
.
Consequently, the questions that neuroscientists ask are wide-ranging: how do electrical and molecular signals allow neurons to process and transmit information from the environment? What guides the development of the immense number of precise connections in the nervous system? How can the complex signals of many thousands of active neurons be recorded and interpreted? What causes the profound behavioral deficits in Alzheimers disease or Autism Spectrum Disorders?.

Foundational Courses.
If you are interested in studying the life sciences, we encourage you to explore the interdisciplinary foundational courses.
  These courses offer a unique approach to learning science.
.
Fall semester:.
We offer two options in the fall semester; you should enroll in the course that best suits your high school preparation.
  Incoming students should take the on-line placement exams in chemistry and biology for placement recommendations.
  Both fall semester courses cover topics in chemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology.
.
Life Sciences 1a.
(LS 1a) integrates chemical and biological concepts throughout the semester, and applies these concepts to issues of broad interest such as HIV and cancer.
  The semester culminates in a project in which students propose novel experimental directions for a scientific question of their choice.
.
Life and Physical Sciences A.
(LPS A), which is aimed at students with less high school preparation, introduces topics in general chemistry in the first half of the semester, followed by topics in molecular and cellular biology.
.
Spring semester:.
Life Sciences 1b.
(LS 1b) covers topics in genetics, genomics, and evolution.
  The semester culminates with symposia that draw together scientific and medical experts, patients, and patient advocates, who discuss genetic disorders that students investigated during the course.
.
The combination of LS 1a/LPS A and LS 1b serves as a foundation for further study in any area of the life sciences.
  The courses are open to both concentrators and non-concentrators, and also count for General Education requirements and pre-medical requirements.
  While a majority of students take these classes as freshmen, upper class students also enroll in LS 1a, LPS A, and LS 1b.
.
The foundational courses provide an exciting introduction to contemporary questions in the life sciences and promote valuable problem-solving skills, regardless of what you end up studying at Harvard.
.
Principles & Goals.
The life sciences curriculum at Harvard rests on an interdisciplinary set of foundational courses.

Foundational Courses FAQs.
What are the introductory courses in the life sciences?.
Life Sciences 1a (LS 1a) and Life Sciences 1b (LS 1b) were designed as the foundation for the life sciences concentrations.
  Based on your background preparation, Life and Physical Sciences A (LPS A) may serve as an alternative to LS 1a.
 The fall semester courses, LS 1a and LPS A, introduce chemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology.
  LS 1b, which is offered in the spring, covers topics in genetics, genomics, and evolution.
.
If I am a freshman, which life sciences class should I take in the fall?.
For course advice, you should take the biology and chemistry placement exams.
  Based on the results of the placement exams, you will receive a recommendation for your fall course – either LS 1a or LPS A.
  If you are unsure of which course to take, you should talk with a life sciences advisor.
  A team of life sciences advisors will be available to talk with you at the Science Advising Session in the Science Center during Opening Days.
.
What is the difference between LS 1a and LPS A?.
Both LS 1a and LPS A are offered in the fall and are introductory courses in biology and chemistry.
  LS 1a integrates chemical and biological principles throughout the semester, and also applies these concepts to larger biological problems such as HIV and cancer.
  LPS A is aimed at students who, based on their background in chemistry or biology, require additional preparation before taking further science courses at Harvard.

Beyond the.
foundational courses.
and the.
gateway courses.
, you can choose from a wide array of life sciences courses.
  Intermediate-level courses (typically those with numbers below 100) allow you to explore fundamental concepts from a variety of fields, ranging from plant biology to biochemistry.
  Upper-level courses (typically those with numbers over 100) delve into topics in more depth.
.
These classes often emphasize reading and analyzing the primary literature, and many include writing and speaking components.
  For example, you might write a grant proposal to investigate an intriguing scientific question, and you might give a presentation in which you explain a recent scientific discovery to your classmates.
.
In addition to life sciences courses offered in Cambridge, some students enroll in courses offered through the.
Division of Medical Sciences.
at Harvard Medical School.
  Travel to the HMS campus is often required for those courses; a.

Astrophysics.
The concentration in Astrophysics builds the foundation from which students may consider some of the deepest questions of the physical universe.
 What was the state and composition of the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang? What is the nature of the force that currently dominates the expansion of the Universe? How do space and time behave in the vicinity of the black hole? How do galaxies form, and how do stars and planets form within those galaxies? Are there habitable worlds other than our own?.
The science of astrophysics involves the study of matter and radiation in the universe as understood through the laws of physics.
 Astronomical phenomena exhibit an extreme range of physical conditions, from superfluid neutrons in neutron stars, high-temperature nuclear reactions in supernovae, and strong gravitational fields near black holes, to the unique state of the universe during its earliest phases.
 Theoretical attempts to describe these and more familiar phenomena (such as stars and galaxies) have achieved a useful understanding in many cases.
 However, our overall knowledge of the universe is still woefully incomplete, and our contemporary physical knowledge is often stretched to its limits in attempting to understand physical conditions that cannot be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories.

Chemistry and Physics.
Physics and Chemistry are intellectual neighbors, sharing a large and somewhat arbitrary boundary.
 Scientists in this exciting boundary area study many of the same systems.
  They use many of the same experimental and theoretical tools.
 The concentration in Chemistry and Physics is supervised by a committee comprised of members of the Departments of Physics and of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, and is administered through the office of the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
 As the name suggests, the concentration has been established to serve students wishing to explore this boundary who need to develop a strong foundation in both physics and chemistry.
 Because of the need to cover a wide range of material in considerable depth, only an honors-eligible program is available in this concentration.
.
The requirements of the Chemistry and Physics concentration are designed to provide a solid foundation for further study in either or both of these two closely related sciences.
 Concentrators have gone on to graduate work and careers in chemistry, physics, and other quantitative fields.
 The concentration is also often chosen by students whose career goals lie in medicine.
 In addition, the intellectual disciplines involved provide a suitable background for careers in many different professions.

Earth and Planetary Sciences.
Harvard offers outstanding opportunities for students who wish to pursue studies in Earth and planetary sciences.
 Research and course work in the Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) department encompass a broad range of science disciplines, technology, and applications to environmental and economic endeavors.
 These studies involve students in the development and application of new tools and technologies, state-of-the-art computational modeling of a wide range of Earth planetary processes, and field work in remote and challenging settings.
.
These are intellectually exciting times for the Earth and planetary sciences, which are of unprecedented importance to contemporary society.
 Our environment is increasingly subject to stresses placed upon it.
 As never before, we have an imperative to better understand the consequences of human activities for the Earth’s atmosphere, the oceans, the solid Earth, and the organisms that live on it.
 Exploring for, extracting, and conserving natural resources are vital to the global political economy.
 We must mitigate the ill effects of earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and climate change by learning to predict their time and place.
 Moreover, new technologies, datasets and computational capacity are allowing us to better understand the functioning of Earth systems and the interplay between tectonics, climate, and life.

Environmental Science and Public Policy.
The concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy (ESPP) is designed to provide a multidisciplinary introduction to current problems of the environment.
 It is founded on the premise that the ability to form rational judgments concerning many of the complex challenges confronting society today involving the environment requires both an understanding of the underlying scientific and technical issues and an appreciation for the relevant economic, political, legal, historical, and ethical dimensions.
 All students have to satisfy a core of requirements in the physical, biological, and social sciences and mathematics.
 Depending on preparation, students may be encouraged to substitute more advanced courses for these requirements.
 In consultation with their concentration advisor, students also develop an individual plan of study for a series of advanced courses around a particular field of specialization.
 Through their field of specialization, students develop expertise in a particular field of study relating to the environment.
*.
In the junior year, students take one or more seminars to complement their field of specialization.
 The seminars are envisaged as a central integrating component of the concentration.
 The seminars cover a number of current environmental issues, comprehensively and in depth.
 They are taught by faculty from a number of departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and from several of the professional schools, including the Kennedy School of Government, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate School of Design and the Business School.
 Topics covered change from year to year, but have included policy issues relating to environmental health, ecology and land use, renewable energy, conservation and biodiversity, and environmental crises, climate change and population flight.

Mathematics.
Mathematics is the science of order, and mathematicians seek to identify instances of order and to formulate and understand concepts that enable us to perceive order in complicated situations.
.
Perhaps the most important concept of mathematics is that of function, which provides us with the means to study dependence and change.
 The study of real functions of a real variable (and later complex functions), particularly in connection with the limit concept, is called analysis.
 The most effective tool for this study is the infinitesimal calculus that analyzes the relation between functions and their derivatives.
 The study of number systems and their generalizations is called algebra.
 Here the primary concepts are group, ring, field, and module.
 The last great branch of mathematics is geometry, which now goes far beyond the classical study of the space we live in to include spaces of high dimension and topology, the abstract theory of shape.

Statistics.
Statistics is a relatively young discipline, organized around the rapidly growing body of knowledge about principled methods for data collection and data analysis, the making of rational decisions under uncertainty, and the modeling of randomness in any quantitative inquiries, including the social, natural, and medical sciences.
 Statistics has a theoretical core surrounded by a large number of domains of application in fields such as anthropology, astronomy, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, education, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, finance, forensic science, geophysical sciences, government, history, law, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, physics, population science, psychology, sociology, and many others.
 A basic goal of the concentration in Statistics is to help students acquire the conceptual, computational, and mathematical tools for quantifying uncertainty and making sense of complex data arising from many applications - including statistically sound ways of collecting such data.
 The mathematical preparation required includes multivariable calculus and linear algebra to the level of Mathematics 19A and 19B (or preferably Mathematics 21A and 21B, or above).
 The computational preparation required includes Computer Science 50, or above.

Physics.
The concentration in Physics, administered by the Department of Physics, serves a variety of goals and interests.
 Many concentrators seek an understanding of the subtle, profound, and fundamental laws—relativity, quantum mechanics, and the basic force laws—that govern the behavior of all matter.
 Often these studies involve the smallest units of matter: molecules, atoms, nuclei, and sub-nuclear particles.
 A major interest of other Physics concentrators is the exploration and explanation of the diverse properties to which these laws give rise in macroscopic systems such as fluids and solids.
 Still others study aspects of more complex systems like oceans and atmospheres, stars, and living matter.
.
A concentration in Physics provides a foundation for subsequent professional work in physics, and also for work in computer science, astronomy, biophysics, chemical physics, engineering and applied physics, earth and planetary sciences, geology, astrophysics, and the history and philosophy of science.
 Less obviously perhaps, the intellectual attitudes in physics -- blending imagination, prediction, observation, and deduction -- provide an excellent base for subsequent graduate work in professional schools of medicine, education, law, business, and public administration.

Research FAQs.
How do I get started?.
Many Harvard undergraduates participate in life sciences research at one of Harvard’s campuses.
.
If you are a Harvard undergraduate interested in research,.
Undergraduate Science Research Advisor.
Kate Penner.
can help you navigate the process of finding a research group.
 She can help you:.
define your research interests.
navigate research group websites.
create and edit a science resume and cover letter.
identify and contact research groups.
apply for fellowships and funding.
integrate effectively into your research group & make the most of your research experiences.
Before your meeting, think about what kinds of research interest you.
 What science courses did you enjoy the most? Did you read an article or hear a speaker discuss a topic that made you want to learn more?.
How do I know what interests me if I have never done research before?.
Even if you have not yet done independent research, you have been introduced to various topics in the life sciences.
 One strategy for choosing a research area is to.
recall particular class topics that captivated your interest.
and made you want to read more.
 Perhaps you completed a special project in high school or read a compelling science article.
 Maybe you even did research during high school.
 Because of the multitude of research opportunities available at Harvard, college is a great time for you to explore new research options and directions.
.
Begin by browsing.
the various.
department and research center web pages.
.
.
Invest time to.
read about faculty research.
; you may find a project that grabs your attention in a research area that you weren’t aware of previously.
 In this broad-based search process, you also learn about the wide range of research projects at Harvard and its affiliated hospitals.
.
Once you identify a few labs whose research interests you (5 or 6 is usually sufficient),.
read 1-2 publications from each lab.
to learn about the group’s research focus, model systems, techniques, and overall goals.
 If you consider the amount of time that you will spend working in the lab or the field, whether it is full-time during the summer or part-time during the academic year, it makes sense to take the time to investigate a number of research options and identify the ones that will likely be a good fit for you and your interests and career goals.
.
For more detailed advice, please contact the Undergraduate Research Advisor,.
Kate Penner.
.
.
How do I contact and interview in the labs that I am interested in?.
Once you have narrowed down your list of labs,.
send an introductory email.
inquiry directly to the faculty member who heads the research group (the Principal Investigator or P.
I.
).
 Tailor each email specifically for each lab; do not write a generic letter.
.
Opening few sentences:.
Start by introducing yourself and the purpose of your inquiry.
(i.
e.
 you’d like to speak about summer research opportunities in their lab).
 Next, because you will have already done background reading,.
mention specific aspects of their research.
(citing the lab’s papers you have read) and.
state.
why.
they interest you.
.
 Your application will be stronger if you convey not only some knowledge of the lab’s scientific goals, but also a genuine interest in their research area and technical approaches.
.
Next paragraph:.
Tell them about yourself, what your goals are and why you want to do research with their group.
.
Describe any previous research experience (as described below, attach your science resume).
.
Previous experience may be helpful, but is not required for joining many research groups.
.
Many undergraduates have not had much, if any, previous experience; professors are looking for students who are highly motivated to learn and dependable.
.
A brief closing:.
Give a timeline of your expected start date, how many hours per week you can devote during the academic term, and what your plans are for the summer.
.
Attach a copy of your.
science resume.
,.
which differs from a typical resume in its focus and concision.
.
List the science courses.
you have taken and in which you are currently enrolled (if you are applying to labs outside of the Harvard FAS, list the course title in addition to the course number).
.
Condense your high school information.
: list only the top 2-3 science experiences or accomplishments, and selected academic awards.
 A one-page science resume will convey key information and be easy to read.
.
Most faculty will respond to your email if it is clear that you are genuinely interested in their research and have not simply sent out a generic email.
 If you don’t receive a response with a week or ten days, you can follow up with an email asking if they have had a chance to consider your request.
 (Include you original correspondence at the end of your follow-up email.
) Often faculty are traveling and don't have regular access to email, so you may have to be patient.
 It's also helpful to be aware of busy times of year (such as weeks at the start of the academic term for faculty who also teach).
.
If you get a response inviting you to an interview,.
make sure that you have a broad understanding.
of the major areas of the faculty's research program.
 Also be sure to.
read 1-2 published papers.
from the lab so you can.
ask specific questions.
about their research.
 If there are other undergraduates working in the lab already, you can contact them and ask about their experiences.
 For more detailed advise on interview preparation and making decision on which lab to choose from all your offers please contact the.
Undergraduate Research Advisor.
.
.
Each fall Science Education Office brings together Harvard scientists from various departments, institutes and hospitals together for the Harvard Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Science (HUROS) fair.
 HUROS is a great way to meet dozens of scientists in one day and explore multiple research areas before narrowing down your interest.
 Please register for the event at.
HUROS.
page of this site.
.
Do I have to stay in the same lab all 4 years or can I try different labs?.
The short answer is no, you are not required to remain in the same lab for your entire undergraduate career.
 There are many reasons for changing a lab:.
your academic interests or concentration may have changed and thus the lab project is no longer appropriate.
you would like to.
study abroad.
(note that there is no additional cost in tuition for the term-time study abroad and Harvard has many fellowships for summer study abroad programs).
your mentor may have moved on and there is no one in the lab to direct your project (it is not unusual for a postdoctoral fellow who is co-mentoring student to move as they secure a faculty position elsewhere).
the project may not be working and the lab hasn’t offered an alternative.
or there may be personal reasons for leaving.
  It is acceptable to move on.
If you do encounter difficulties, but you strongly prefer to remain in the lab, get help.
  Talk to your PI or mentor, or reach out to.
Undergraduate Research Advisor.
for advice.
 The PI may not be aware of the problem and bringing it to their attention may be all that is necessary to resolve it.
.
For students who are satisfied with their research experience, remaining in one lab for the duration of their undergraduate careers can have significant benefits.
 Students who spend two or three years in the same lab often find that they have become fully integrated members of the research group.
 In addition, the continuity of spending several years in one lab group often allows students to develop a high level of technical expertise that permits them to work on more sophisticated projects and perhaps produce more significant results.
.
Students may volunteer, receive a.
course credit.
or apply for.
Harvard Research Fellowships.
.
 Students who are on Financial Aid Work-Study may apply it towards their research stipend.
.
Please contact.
Undergraduate Research Advisor.
for advise on your specific situation.
.
Student Responsibilities in the Lab: Lab citizenship and effort.
Accepting an undergraduate into a research group and providing training for them is a very resource-intensive proposition for a lab, both in terms of the time commitment required from the lab mentors as well as the cost of laboratory supplies and reagents.
 It is incumbent upon students to recognize and respect this investment.
.
One way for you to acknowledge the lab’s investment is to show that you appreciate the time that your mentors set aside from their own experiments to teach you.
 For example, try to be meticulous about letting your mentor know well in advance when you are unable to come to the lab as scheduled.
.
On the other hand, showing up in the lab at a time that is not on your regular schedule and expecting that your mentor will be available to work with you is unrealistic because they may be in the middle of an experiment that cannot be interrupted for several hours.
.
In addition to adhering to your lab schedule, show you respect the time that your mentor is devoting to you by putting forth a sincere effort when you are in the lab.
  This includes turning off your phone, ignoring text messages, avoiding surfing the web and chatting with your friends in the lab etc.
 You will derive more benefit from a good relationship with your lab both in terms of your achievements in research and future interactions with the PI if you demonstrate a sincere commitment to them.
 We have heard reports from some PIs who were unhappy with their undergraduates because they did not appear to appreciate the time that their mentors spent working with them.
.
There will be “crunch” times, maybe even whole weeks, when you will be unable to work in the lab as many hours as you normally would because of midterms, finals, paper deadlines, illness or school vacations.
 This is fine and not unusual for students, but remember to let your mentor know in advance when you anticipate absences.
 Disappearing from the lab for days without communicating with your mentor is not acceptable.
 Your lab mentor and PI are much more likely to be understanding about schedule changes if you keep the lines of communication open but they may be less charitable if you simply disappear for days or weeks at a time.
 From our conversations with students, we have learned that maintaining good communication and a strong relationship with the lab mentor and/or PI correlates well with an undergraduate’s satisfaction and success in the laboratory.
.
Perhaps the.
best way.
for you to demonstrate your appreciation of the lab’s commitment is to approach your project with genuine interest and intellectual curiosity.
 Regardless of how limited your time in the lab may be, especially for freshmen and sophomores, it is crucial to convey a sincere sense of engagement with your project and the lab’s research goals.
 You want to avoid giving the impression that you are there merely to fulfill a degree requirement or as prerequisite for a post-graduate program.
.
Funding Support.
Students conducting research during the fall or spring terms typically either volunteer or earn course credit.
  For term time financial support, students may also apply for funding through the.
Harvard College Research Program.
(HCRP).
 Students.
may not.
simultaneously receive funding and also earn academic credit for a research project.
.
There are a number of.
fellowships.
available for Harvard undergraduates to support summer research projects.
 Students can also view numerous undergraduate programs and scholarships, including summer research, portable scholarships, and short-term opportunities on the.
Pathways to Science website.

FAQs.
What is the Harvard Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Science (HUROS) Fair?.
The HUROS Fair is an annual poster session where Harvard-affiliated laboratories showcase their current research projects to Harvard College undergraduates.
 Groups come from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute, and Harvard-affiliated hospitals, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, McLean Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
.
Why do we organize the HUROS?.
The HUROS facilitates scientific discussions between Harvard undergraduates and Harvard graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty and other researchers.
 The fair is an effective way both for undergraduates to meet many scientists and learn about their cutting-edge life sciences research and for scientists to describe and explain their experimental approaches.
 The fair benefits both undergraduates and Harvard’s life science researchers.
 Many undergraduates report finding a host lab at the fair, and the Harvard scientists who present a poster relish the chance to speak with a large number of undergraduates, some of whom join their research groups.
.
When is the HUROS?.
HUROS 2023 will be held on October 20, 2023 from 1:00-4:00 pm.
 This timing gives students time to find a host lab and apply for summer research fellowships, which typically have deadlines in January, February, or March.

How augmented reality influences student learning and inquiry styles: A study of 1-1 physics remote AR tutoring.
.
.
Computers & Education: X Reality.
(2023).
.
Publisher's Version.
Abstract.
While augmented reality (AR) technology is being considered by educators for its potential to help students visualize abstract concepts, currently there are barriers from the high cost of developing complex AR applications.
 In this study we investigate how the complexity of AR content impacts student learning in remote 1-1 tutoring scenarios, where an instructor uses an AR headset while teaching physics concepts to a remote student.
 This approach brings the benefits of augmented reality into the already-existing educational practices of 1-1 remote instruction, without requiring AR devices for every student.
 We present a system for AR-based physics instruction and perform a between-subjects study, measuring how student learning and inquiry behaviors differ between two experimental conditions that vary in the complexity of AR content.
 Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, our results show that students who are tutored with more complex AR content learn better and show a wider variety of inquiry styles.
 Furthermore, AR visual representations appear to stimulate students to think about a wide range of scientific ideas, to make deeper connections between scientific concepts, and encourage students to have a more active learning style with increased transitions between inquiry activities.
 We discuss possible reasons and wider implications for these findings.

How gender composition and group formation impact the effectiveness of group work in two-stage collaborative exams.
.
.
Physical Review Physics Education Research.
(2022).
.
Publisher's Version.
Abstract.
Two-stage collaborative exams are an increasingly popular form of formative assessment which have shown promising results in promoting student learning.
 While the benefit of two-stage collaborative exams is well researched, there is no clear consensus on the best way of implementing them—specifically with respect to forming student groups.
 In some studies students self-select their groups, and in others they are assigned by the instructor (either randomly or with a specific grouping algorithm).
 Research has shown that performance and satisfaction in group learning situations improves when faculty, not students, select the groups.
 Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that students’ learning benefits from working in groups with diverse learning styles, abilities, gender, and race.
 In this study, we report on a controlled experiment conducted during a two-stage collaborative exam in an introductory physics course at Harvard University.
 For the group stage of the exam, half of the groups were formed by the instructor (based on balancing gender and performance on previous exams) and the other half were student selected.
 We compared performance on both the individual and group stage of the exam for the instructor-formed versus student-formed groups.
 We also surveyed students on their experiences during the group exam.
 We found that female students perform better on two-part collaborative exams when they are in student-formed groups.
 We also found that in the student-formed groups students (especially female students) felt more comfortable speaking up and felt that their groups were both “more effective and productive” and “more receptive to their ideas” than in the instructor-formed groups.
 This study provides important insights into best practice implementation of two-stage collaborative exams.

Harnessing active engagement in educational videos: Enhanced visuals and embedded questions.
.
.
Physical Review Physics Education Research.
(2022).
.
Publisher's Version.
Abstract.
The prevalence of online instruction highlights the importance of videos in education.
 Pedagogies that include elements that actively engage students are accepted as an improvement over more passive modes of instruction.
 How can we transfer the advantages of active engagement to instruction via video? Previous research on instructional videos has shown that there are a number of principles, the adherence to which benefit student learning by maximizing productive cognitive processing.
 To understand the impact of combining such principles we designed and produced four different versions of the same physics demonstration video, varying levels of “visual enhancement” designed around these principles and the amount of active engagement across the different versions.
 Using pre-post video testing, we compared how much viewers learned across the four different versions.
 We found that actively engaging students by embedding questions throughout the video increases student learning.
 We also found that physics videos are most effective when they include enhanced visuals.
and.
embedded questions.
 Notably, it is the combination that matters most; the learning effect from embedding questions is increased when the video also includes enhanced visuals.
 This study represents an important step towards understanding how instructors can design and refine their videos to maximize student learning.
.
Increased learning in a college physics course with timely use of short multimedia summaries.
.
.
Physical Review Physics Education Research.
(2022).
.
Publisher's Version.
Abstract.
The typical introductory physics lecture requires students to consolidate and assimilate a large quantity of complex information that is often novel to them.
 This can leave students overwhelmed, slow the pace of their learning, and lower their motivation.
 We find that carefully designed multimedia summaries in the form of one-minute videos and short text summaries can significantly increase students’ understanding of the material as well as their ability to organize information into a useful mental framework, as measured by their performances on a concept mapping exercise and a conceptual test of learning.
 Notably, we show that these improvements can be achieved with negligible increase in overall time students spend on the course material each week.
 We discuss reasons why these short postlecture summaries helped students learn more, namely, that (i) they likely increased students’ ability to chunk and organize information while minimizing the extraneous cognitive load imposed by the materials, and (ii) they likely improved students’ ability to consolidate and transfer knowledge through the use of contrasting cases.
 We provide a set of detailed recommendations that instructors can use to develop effective postlecture multimedia summaries.
 We suggest that one of the most important and impactful recommendations is incorporating student thinking in the design of these types of summaries informed by the input of qualified former students or teaching assistants with significant experience interacting with students in the course.

GUIDELINES.
How do I prepare a poster?.
Many fellowship programs, such as PRISE and Herchel Smith, require their fellows to give oral presentations or posters on their projects at the end of the program.
 Other fellowship programs, such as HCRP, require a written progress report.
 One reason for this requirement is that learning to communicate research results, either through an oral presentation or preparation of a poster or paper, is an important part of a scientist’s training.
 Another important reason for requiring these presentations or papers is to ensure that students have taken some ownership and responsibility for their projects.
.
These presentations or papers are not expected to be final articles on your results, but rather progress reports on what you have accomplished thus far.
 If your program does not provide set guidelines for the paper, you should discuss it with your research mentor well in advance of the deadline; they may have advice or suggest a particular format.
 Don’t plan to prepare an overly technical paper that emphasizes experimental details.
 Instead, we recommend that students focus their writing on the "big picture" - what are the scientific questions that led to your research project, and how does your project fit into the context of the field as a whole? Describe your hypothesis and explain how your experiments test that hypothesis.
 Include a summary of your experimental strategy, but avoid writing a detailed "methods" section unless your lab mentor or fellowship program requires you to do so or if your project involved developing or optimizing an experimental technique or protocol.
 If you have results you should describe them, and be sure to convey how your findings relate to your hypothesis.
 Your conclusion should summarize your project and focus on what the next steps should be.
 Do not worry if your results are unexpected, inconclusive, or even if you don't have any results.
.
The best thing to do is to be proactive and discuss the paper with your mentor(s) early in the writing process (at the very minimum, three weeks before the paper is due).
 It is likely that they have had similar experiences in their career, and they may have reassuring comments and advice to help you get started.
.
Note, each conference/fellowship has specific guidelines on how poster should be prepared and poster size requirements.
 Please consult website of the conference you are attending for more specific information.

FAQs: Hosting Undergraduates in your Lab.
Recruiting and Interviewing.
Recruiting students.
:.
- Any Harvard-affiliated faculty can host a Harvard undergraduate student in their lab, including faculty at the Harvard Medical School, Harvard Dental School, Harvard Institutes (Ragon, Weiss, Rowland, Dana Farber, etc.
), Harvard-affiliated hospitals (Boston Children’s, MGH, McLean Hospital, etc.
).
- If you have an Undergraduate Research Opportunity, you are encouraged to contact the.
Harvard Science Education Office.
in order to post the opportunity on the undergraduate.
Science Education website.
.
 Our.
undergraduate research advisor.
advises hundreds of individual students each semester and can refer students with an interest in your research discipline to you once the position is posted online.
.
- The undergraduate Science Education Office in the FAS Division of Science organizes an annual Harvard Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Science poster event (HUROS) in November, which is a great opportunity to meet with dozens of undergraduates in one day.
 You, your postdoctoral scholars or graduate students can represent your research group.
 For more information about registering for the poster event check the.
HUROS website.
.
.
Interviewing.
:.
we recognize your experience in interviewing, below are few tips to consider.
.
Find out why your candidate is interested in doing research, as their motives will be important in other practical aspects: duration, number of hours per week, etc.
.
Student background in science, math, statistics and computational skills will help you determine level of preparedness to undertake a research project.
 Ask what courses they took that had practical components such as lab and what specific skills that are relevant to your research projects students might have acquired through their coursework or work/volunteer experience.
 For faculty who are not familiar with the Harvard College curriculum, a course syllabus (available from the student) can help you learn more about content of the courses your students took.
.
Explain research project(s) for which you are hiring undergraduate students.
 Note, that undergraduate research project design has to be carefully considered (given student background and amount of mentoring it will take to help student learn lab skills, student availability, duration of the position).
 Most of our students work on a hypothesis-driven project and not just perform lab tech duties.
 Listing several potential projects available in your group will allow student to have autonomy in choosing the one they are most passionate about.
 For more practical aspects on designing student projects, please consult.
Faculty Handbook.
.
 Students need to know what particular lab skills they will be exposed to, model organisms, lab equipment, field work or any other aspects.
 What safety training will be required to operate equipment or conduct certain set of experiments.
.
Note, if you are just interested in a lab tech/research assistant, you can post a research assistant position, with a very clear description of duties and state that it is not an independent research project.
 These types of positions are most often paid (by the lab, since Harvard fellowships support only hypothesis-driven independent student research).
.
Faculty Aide program.
can subsidize part of the student stipend for paid research assistants.
.
Science Education offers series of.
Mentoring Workshops.
that provide training on fellowships available to Harvard undergraduates to support their undergraduate research and mentor’s role in supporting application process, how to write descriptive and accurate letters of recommendation, develop undergraduate research projects, set appropriate expectations, and foster effective communication.
 Workshops use many case-studies to explore these topics in more detail.
 All Harvard-affiliated researchers are welcome to participate in these free of charge workshops (registration is first come first serve basis).
.
Discuss with the student your expectations: number of hours per week, duration, the type of schedule research project requires, lab meeting attendance policy, journal clubs, etc.
 These expectations should be summarized in a written agreement and sign by the student.
.
Mentoring environment: explain to the student who will be his/her direct day to day mentor.
 It could be principal investigator, postdoc, lab manager, graduate student or researcher working in the lab.
 Whether it is 1 mentor or 2 mentors (PI – overall mentor and postdoc for day to day supervision), it is important that the student meets and interviews with them too, introduce your student to other people in the lab as you walk through the lab tour and show lab equipment and any other interesting model systems….
Logistical considerations: funding/compensation, vocation (note Harvard students do not have housing during the winter and summer breaks, unless they apply for a fellowship or some special program), student exam schedule, transportation to your laboratory.
.
Provide information to the student on to when they can expect to hear from you and what are the next steps in the recruitment process.
.
Compensation and Work Hours.
Once you identify a student, please fill out.
this form.
.
.
We collect Harvard undergraduate placement data for internal reporting purposes.
 In addition, students who have been conducting research are often invited to present their research at the biannual.
Undergraduate Research Spotlight event.
.
.
Types of work arrangement.
Harvard students can either:.
Volunteer, this option can range for 3-4 months (one academic term) to 2 terms to 1-2 years.
 Some students depending on their financial aid situation may need a paid position.
 These positions must be primarily for the educational benefit of the student volunteer.
 For more information please contact.
Undergraduate Research Advisor.
.
.
Receive course-credit (this option is most applicable to the Juniors and Seniors).
 Please ask your student to contact their concentration (major) advisor to obtain departmental requirements for registering for the course credit and information on how many hours a week students are required to work in the lab by their department (each concentration has different requirements).
 They have to register before the regular course registration deadline.
.
Do thesis research in your lab.
 Note that thesis topic has to be approved by the student’s concentration advisor.
 Check departmental and college deadlines for submitting thesis title and actual thesis (each concentration has specific deadlines).
.
Obtain Harvard fellowships.
 Harvard offers.
comprehensive list of fellowships.
to support Harvard undergraduate researcher stipends.
.
HCRP fellowship.
is offered during the term time and summer time.
 During the term most of our students obtain stipend through the HCRP.
 During the summer.

Rosenkrantz Travel Grants.
This grant program is exclusively for concentrators in History and Science.
  It allows motivated rising juniors  (who have completed sophomore tutorial) and who are concentrating in history and science to devise a short but meaningful plan of travel and academic discovery in the United States or abroad.
 This grant program may serve as the first stage of research towards a senior thesis or junior research paper, but there is no requirement that it do so.
 The only requirement is a sincere passion for adventure and exploration, and a willingness to prepare well for the experience.

 Each student is assigned to a specific MGH laboratory, clinical site, health policy, or health services research area where they undertake an original research project under the mentorship and guidance of a Mass General Hospital (MGH) investigator.
 Assignments are carefully considered and are made with the student's research and career interests in mind.
 In addition to this unique research experience, students will gain knowledge through weekly didactic seminars, both at the MGH and at Harvard Medical School, attend career development workshops and networking event, and have opportunities for clinical shadowing.

 This grant program may serve as the first stage of research towards a senior thesis or junior research paper, but there is no requirement that it do so.
 The only requirement is a sincere passion for adventure and exploration, and a willingness to prepare well for the experience.

Faculty Aide Program.
Please note: Only faculty members may apply for the Faculty Aide Program.
.
What is the Faculty Aide Program?.
The Faculty Aide Program (FAP) is a valuable program for students in the initial stages of their research careers and for faculty looking to take advantage of the program's wage -sharing benefit.
  The program has provied thousands of opportunities for undergraduates from all concentrations to become closely involved in the ongoing research of a Harvard faculty member.
.
Faculty Aide applications are accepted throughout the year, but applications submitted by June 1, 2024 are guaranteed* to recieve funding.
.
How does the Faculty Aide Program work?.
Payment to students in the Faculty Aide Program is split between the SEO and the faculty member.
 The SEO is able to fund the faculty member up to $3000 towards student wages (to be used for one student's wages or split among many) over the course of the fiscal year.
 The faculty member must match the wages earned with their own separate funding.
  The maximum a faculty member can request from the SEO is $3000 (to be matched by the faculty member's departmental funding).
 This can be used for one project or split amongst multiple projects.
 Any charges in excess will be charged back to the faculty member's departmental budget through a journal entry in the University accounting system or billed to Harvard affiliates off-campus.
.
How do I find a student?.
Students often become Faculty Aides by contacting professors or responding to research assistant job listings in the Student Employment Office (SEO).
Jobs Database.
.
 Faculty members must list students they would like to hire on their application before it will be approved.
.
Faculty Aide applications are accepted throughout the year, but posting your Research Assistant position early in the semester increases your chances of finding the right student.
.
Determining a Pay Rate.
There is no set pay rate for the Faculty Aide Program so the faculty and student are able to negotiate an appropriate hourly wage.
 Students have to be paid no less than Massachusetts minimum wage $15/hr.
.
You may refer to the student employee.
wage ranges.
page to help determine the pay rate for your student aide.
.
The estimated number of hours worked should be considered when determining the pay rate to ensure that payments in excess of the Faculty Aide award are not charged to the allowable restricted funds.
.
Any charges in excess will be charged back to the faculty member/department through a journal entry in the University accounting system or billed to Harvard affiliates off-campus.
.
Hiring Students Through PeopleSoft.
The SEO will hire all students through PeopleSoft.
 All students are required to complete onboarding documents including tax forms and the I-9 Form before they can begin work.
 Students cannot begin working until they are notified by the SEO.
 Faculty members and students will receive email notification both when the student has been hired in PeopleSoft and when they are ready to begin work.
.
How do I apply for funding?.
Faculty Aide applications are accepted throughout the year, but applications submitted by June 1, 2024 are guaranteed* to recieve funding.
.
Faculty members submit an.
online application.
and will receive an e-mail confirmation upon review of their application.
.
Approved applicants can be awarded awarded up to one $3000 grant to be used by one student/project or divided among several.
 Faculty may not receive more than one Faculty Aide award of $3000 each fiscal year.
 Each dollar earned by the Faculty Aide(s) must be matched by the faculty member.
.
FAP cannot be used to pay the wages of a student who has also received a grant from the Harvard College Research Program (HCRP) or any other Harvard supported research award.
.
*All applications must meet requirements as listed on the Faculty Aide Program website.
 The amount of funding will be distributed based on factors as determined by the Student Employment Office (SEO).

Federal Work Study.
The Federal Work Study Program (FWSP) is a federally-funded financial aid program available to US citizens and permanent residents.
 The goal of the program is to assist students with the cost of their college education by providing a subsidy to employers for part-time student employment.
 The program is dependent on the student applying for financial aid through the FAFSA and qualifying based on their financial need.
.
FWSP may be used during the summer, and eligibility is based on the FAFSA for the following school term.
 Visit the.
Summer FWSP.
page for more information about using FWSP during summer break.
.
FWSP comes with rules and regulations for.
student.
and.
employer eligibility.
.
 To comply with the law, the University has established guidelines and processes that must be followed by both students and employers.
.
Many students are confused by the term ‘work-study’ and think that they are eligible for this benefit simply based on the grounds that they are working while studying at college.
 While all students are welcome to work during their time at Harvard, ‘work-study’ refers specifically to the federally-funded financial aid program designed to help students meet their education costs via subsidized hourly work.
.
Frequently Asked Questions.
Can I have more than one job on Work Study?.

Research Opportunities.
Performing research can be a very enriching and transformative part of your undergraduate experience at the College.
 You may encounter it as part of your coursework, but it can also be something you do outside of the classroom as a way to gain practical skills, learn about methods of inquiry and contribute actively to the advancement of study in your field.
.
Finding a research opportunity will require you to be proactive, build.
faculty relationships.
, and use.
key resources.
.
 It may be good to start by charting your personal goals and interests in order to help you identify opportunities that are a match for them.
 Remember to give yourself plenty of time for your search and to remain flexible and open-minded through the process.
 Engaging with the research community at Harvard is possible for students in all concentrations.
 Whether you have participated in research work previously, or are just getting started, there are opportunities designed to meet you where you are right now.
.
Research opportunities come in many formats and happen in a variety of settings.
 They often start off as a question that someone wants to explore more fully.
 Faculty, for example, initiate research projects designed for this purpose.
 It might also begin with you! In your studies, for example, you may have noticed a lack of knowledge or a lack of recent work on a particular topic that interests you.
 With the guidance of a faculty mentor, you could be the person to explore and find answers to fill in the void of missing information.
.
Depending on the scale of a project, you might find yourself working on a team or operating on your own and coordinating your efforts with those of a faculty mentor.
 This work may take place on campus, at other domestic locations, or even internationally, during term-time or over the course of the summer.
.
Some common formats of research experiences for undergraduates include:.
Course-based Research.
Courses (existing or independent study).
 Many courses at Harvard and neighboring institutions (where you can.
cross-register.
) have a strong research component.
 There is even the option for you to design an independent study course.
 To explore these options, the best starting point is with a concentration adviser knowledgeable about course offerings and policies in that concentration.
 You can also visit the.
Advising Programs Office.
(APO) to connect with undergraduate concentration advisers.
.
Research Assistantships.
There are many opportunities to work as a research assistant on an existing project.
 A research assistantship is an excellent opportunity for students with little experience to get their first exposure to research.
 Research assistantship postings can be found on department webpages, at research centers, as well as on the Student Employment Office.
Job Board.
.
 You can also check with nearby hospitals and research groups, in addition to faculty and grad students.
 If you have never contacted research investigators before, check out our tips on how to effectively.
reach out to faculty.
.
.
Research Programs.
In lieu of performing research via a course or an assistantship, you might consider looking at a research program.
 Depending on the program, you might work on a project designed by a member of faculty or propose your own question to pursue under the guidance of a faculty mentor.
 URAF summer programs, for example, are designed to correspond to specific academic areas (i.
e.
, STEM, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences), forming a cohort of fellows working on various topics in their area of interest.
.
URAF research programs are offered on an annual basis, with pre-set start- and end-times, and require formal applications with strict deadlines.
 These programs often have different eligibility criteria (i.
e.
, GPA, class year, research experience).
 Some programs require previous field-specific experience, while other are designed for newcomers to that particular field of study.
 Many research programs include various forms of financial support (e.
g.
 stipends, accommodation, etc.
) as well as opportunities for community-building and intellectual growth.
.
Thesis Research.
Each concentration has its own requirements for thesis research, including topics allowed, prerequisites, timing, and who can supervise your work.
 If you are interested in thesis research, connect with advisers appointed by the concentrations for guiding undergraduates—information about.
concentration advisers.
can be found on the APO website.
 Also, check out our tips on how to effectively.
reach out to faculty.
.
.
Some questions to ask yourself when looking for a program are:.
Where do you want to be?.
What type of research would you like to do?.
Does the program offer additional support or programming that may be helpful?.
How long do you intend to do research?.
The.
Browse URAF opportunities.
page of our website aggregates a large number of Harvard undergraduate research options.
 Please note, however, that not all Harvard-affiliated schools and programs are listed here.
 To ensure you are learning about all potential opportunities, don’t forget to consult faculty advisers, concentration advisers, and academic advisers to identify programs that match your interests and desired outcomes most closely.
.
Beyond browsing through URAF opportunities, you can explore our.
External Resources.
page which provides another starting point for finding research opportunities, including research programs.
 Some are based at Harvard, while others are located across the US and worldwide.
 You can also use Google to search for research programs related to your topic and interests.
 Try using the keywords, "undergraduate research" or "summer undergraduate research.
".
If you have previously performed research at Harvard, you too might consider how you would benefit from.
exploring external opportunities.
.
 Exposure to research and processes at different institutions will allow you to expand your professional and academic networks, to explore a new place and even new ways of investigating topics that interest you.
.
At whatever point you happen to be in your undergraduate trajectory, URAF is here to support you through each stage of the process.
 You can even check out our.
remote-ready.
resources webpages if you intend to perform all or part of your research online.

FAQs.
Application & Participation.
What does PRISE stand for?.
PRISE stands for the Program for Research in Science and Engineering.
.
Why is the Program being offered?.
PRISE has been developed in response to the May 2005 report of the Task Force on Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), which recommended the development of a summer residential community for undergraduate scholars in the sciences.
.
This popular Program has been designed to enable motivated undergraduates to pursue summer research and also participate in a social network that will enhance the experience.
.
Who is eligible for PRISE?.
Any continuing Harvard undergraduate (current freshmen, sophomores, and juniors) in good standing conducting research with Harvard-affiliated Faculty over the summer in the Cambridge-Boston-Longwood area is eligible to apply for the Program.
.
Does this mean anyone is eligible?.
Yes, as long as the applicant is in good standing in the College.
.
Can I apply to PRISE again if I have already participated in the program?.
Students who have already participated in PRISE in previous summers are ineligible to participate again, but may apply to be a proctor or program assistant.
 Students who have participated in another summer research village program (e.
g.
, BLISS, PRIMO, SHARP, SPUDS, or SURGH) may apply, however preference will be given to individuals who have not yet participated in another summer research village program.
.
How important is academic achievement?.
PRISE seeks to attract all undergraduates who are motivated to pursue scientific research during the summer.
.
The only specific criteria with respect to academic achievement are good academic standing and coursework and/or experience that would prepare one for research.
 The Program will include an academically diverse population.
 Individuals who have a demonstrated keen interest in the sciences but have not yet had an opportunity to experience laboratory research are encouraged to apply.
 That is also true of students undertaking a research project for their senior honors thesis.
.
Do I have to be from an underrepresented group to be eligible?.
No.
 The Program is designed to attract any continuing undergraduate scientist who is interested in and can contribute to the principles of diverse community involvement.
.
Will PRISE help me get in to Med School?.
Obviously, we cannot guarantee that PRISE will have any impact on any graduate school admissions panel.
 However, PRISE wis a high-profile program that supports summer research, and PRISE Fellows will benefit from the opportunity to develop an interdisciplinary network of peers.
 Many undergraduates do not have the opportunity to participate in this kind of science community until much later in their careers.
 In addition, prominent scientists will participate in activities with the Fellows throughout the Program.
.
How does the application cycle work?.
Application instructions are available beginning in mid January.
 Complete applications are submitted via the Centralized Application for Research and Travel (CARAT), before 11:59pm on Wednesday, February 14, 2024.
 The selection process will conclude by the second week of March and applicants will be notified of results before the beginning of April.
 After an applicant has been selected, they must re-verify that their research opportunity with a Harvard Faculty member has been secured, and commit to the schedule and activities for the duration of PRISE.
.
What does ".
.
.
diverse community of scientists" mean?.
One of the goals of PRISE is to generate interest and enthusiasm for the development and preservation of stimulating undergraduate communities in scientific research.
 Because women and minorities in many scientific disciplines are comparatively underrepresented by significant margins, both in undergraduate populations and beyond, there is an ongoing interest and commitment in the College to foster substantive and enriching opportunities that inspire these students to pursue their emerging professional goals in science fields.
 In addition, the Program aspires to identify and assist individuals who may not have the opportunity to explore their scientific research interests because of a need to work during the summer.
.
Does the Program pay for health insurance?.
As a continuing Harvard College undergraduate, you are covered by your regular Harvard health insurance during the summer.
.
What is the selection committee looking for?.
Since a primary goal of PRISE is to develop a diverse residential community of undergraduate scientists, the selection committee is looking for individuals who are likely to contribute and gain from participation in such a community.
 Selection will be based on applicant responses to the essay questions and comments in letters of reference that the applicant is strongly suited for a successful summer enrichment experience.
.
Can anyone fill out my evaluation form?.
The evaluation form should be completed by someone in the Harvard academic/research community who can comment on a student's academic initiative and interest in pursuing excellence.
 First year students may consider a high-school academic/research recommender.
 Undergraduate students.
should not provide evaluations.
, even if they are the applicant's TF.
.
I am planning to travel during the month of August.
.
Could I miss the last two weeks of the Program?.
No.
 Individuals who are selected for PRISE must commit to the entire ten-week Program.
.
Concentration.
Is the Program limited to specific concentrations?.
No, applicants may be enrolled in any concentration.
 However, the Program is designed to cultivate a community of science scholars; thus, applicants in non-science concentrations must demonstrate how the research activity they are engaged in will contribute to their development as a scientist.
 The research fields for PRISE are limited to the life, physical, engineering, and applied sciences.
.
I'm a Biology concentrator with 2 years of science courses.
.
Am I eligible?.
Yes.
 PRISE has been designed to cultivate a community of scholars in the sciences.
 Any Harvard undergraduate is eligible as long s/he is committed to performing summer research with a Harvard-affiliated laboratory in the life, physical, engineering, or applied sciences.
.
I'm a humanities concentrator with 1 semester of science courses.
Am I eligible?.
Yes.
 Any Harvard undergraduate is eligible as long as they committed to performing summer research with a Harvard-affiliated laboratory in the life, physical, engineering, or applied sciences.
.
However, archival research, clinical activities, and technical laboratory assistance are not considered significant laboratory research for the purposes of this Program.
.
Will PRISE help me get in to Med School?.
Obviously, we cannot guarantee that PRISE will have any impact on any graduate school admissions panel.
 However, PRISE wis a high-profile program that supports summer research, and PRISE Fellows will benefit from the opportunity to develop an interdisciplinary network of peers.
 Many undergraduates do not have the opportunity to participate in this kind of science community until much later in their careers.
 In addition, prominent scientists will participate in activities with the Fellows throughout the Program.
.
Funding.
Is financial need a factor in selecting PRISE Fellows?.
Selection of PRISE Fellows will be need blind.
 Financial aid recipients are encouraged to apply.
.
Is this research funding?.
PRISE does offer a modest living stipend for fellows who do not receive funding from other sources (e.
g.
, their labs or other fellowships, such as Herchel Smith).
.
If I am a PRISE fellow, may I also get a grant or other award?.
Yes, absolutely.
 Individuals who apply to PRISE are encouraged to seek funding for their independent research activities through one of the College's funding mechanisms, such as the Herchel Smith Summer Undergraduate Science Research Program, funding options available through concentration offices, and other programs.
 In addition, individuals who are working on a significant laboratory project under the direction of Harvard Faculty but are not being paid are also eligible.
 You may learn that your application for PRISE has been approved before you receive funding.
 You need only to verify that you have received a commitment from a Harvard Faculty member to oversee and mentor your research activity for the duration of PRISE.
.
Lab Selection.
Where can I do my research and still participate in PRISE?.
Any laboratory in which a Fellow will be conducting meaningful scientific activity overseen by a Harvard Faculty member on the Cambridge campus or research institutes, or in one of the Boston area hospitals or research institutes is suitable.
 The key is not the lab location but the promise of oversight and mentorship by a Harvard Faculty sponsor.
.
Are there limitations to the kind of research I can do in PRISE?.
The PRISE participant must be engaged in a laboratory activity that supports scientific research in the life, physical, applied or engineering sciences.
 Archival research, clinical activities, and technical laboratory assistance are not considered significant laboratory research for the purposes of this Program.
.
Accommodations.
What are the benefits of participating in PRISE?.
PRISE is an emerging, prestigious program, and the next cohort of PRISE Fellows will be a part of the College's high-profile initiative to support undergraduate research.
.
.
In addition to free housing and a partial meal plan for a 10-week portion of the summer, PRISE will be beneficial in a number of ways:.
The residential community of science scholars will allow Fellows to cultivate an interdisciplinary network of peers with whom they can communicate and collaborate outside the laboratory environment.
 Many undergraduates do not have the opportunity to participate in this kind of science community until much later in their careers.
.
The Program will allow Fellows to delve into topical and critical aspects of becoming a scientist through evening seminars and activities.
.
The Program will foster and encourage Fellows to explore the many exciting pathways and professional opportunities open to those considering a career in the frontiers of science.
.
Can I get housing but not participate in the evening activities?.
No.
 Since a key component of the Program is contribution to the community and professional development, participants must be willing and available to attend enrichment activities and events during non-laboratory work hours.
.
May I live off-campus?.
No.
 All participants will live together in the Harvard Summer Undergraduate Research Village (Leverett House), along with the participants in BLISS (the Behavioral Laboratory for the Social Sciences, PRIMO (the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations), and SHARP (the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program).
.
Instead of the meals offered through the program, can I have access to a kitchen?.
Unfortunately, no.
 Due to existing programs and refurbishing activities across campus during the summer, the Program is limited to the facilities of the residential house of the Summer Undergraduate Research Village.
 Please also note that weekend meals are not included in the Program and very limited cooking facilities are available in the residential facilities.
 If you do have dietary or nutritiotional accommodations, HSURV staff will work fellows and AEO to ensure dining accommodations are secured.
.
Does the Program pay for health insurance?.
As a continuing Harvard College undergraduate, you are covered by your regular Harvard health insurance during the summer.

Summer Thesis Awards.
Each year MBB awards several Mary Gordon Roberts Fellowships to undergraduates to support research that will contribute to their senior honors theses.
 Applicants must be juniors or first-semester seniors in an MBB track, or in the MBB secondary field if they are doing MBB-related theses.
.
Mary Gordon Roberts Fellowships are intended to support living expenses (stipend) and sometimes research expenses.
 Stipends are normally for full-time, ten-week work on your thesis project.
.
If you have already received an award that covers all expenses and precludes further funding (for example, PRISE), or if you anticipate no living or other expenses for your project (for example, if your home residence is local), you may apply for a non-stipendiary award.
 A non-stipendiary Mary Gordon Roberts Fellowship recognizes a high-quality thesis project and can thus be usefully noted in one's resume/CV and on professional/graduate school and employment applications.
.
Because MBB funds are limited, we expect students planning summer thesis research to.
pursue other funding possibilities as well.
, including support from the Harvard College Research Program (HCRP) and your thesis advisor or her/his laboratory/research program.
 MBB usually cannot fully fund students but works with other funding sources like HCRP to make co-awards that will.
.
You will.
use CARAT (the Common Application for Research and Travel) to apply to both the Mary Gordon Roberts Fellowship and the HCRP award.
.
 Log onto CARAT at.
https://carat.
fas.
harvard.
edu.
.
for forms and instructions.
 For the MBB award, complete the CARAT form and upload a project proposal, unofficial transcript, and resume.
 In the budget section, either note “stipend” or “non-stipendiary” in total expenses.
and be sure to leave the rest blank.
, unless you are requesting research support, in which case you should itemize those.
.
Your thesis/research supervisor should also upload a letter of recommendation by the deadline.
.
.
Summer 2024 applications for the Mary Gordon Roberts Fellowship are.
due at noon on Monday, March 25th.
.
If you have any questions about submitting your material, feel free to email them to.
Shawn Harriman.

 He'll be happy to answer them for you.

HSCI Internship Program (HIP).
Intern applications for Summer 2024 HIP programming are now closed.
 Applications will be reviewed by a committee in February with final decisions being communicated via email by mid-April.
 Selected interns will be assigned to projects submitted by HSCI faculty members.
.
Location.
Harvard University, Cambridge & Boston, Massachusetts.
.
Each intern is placed, at the discretion of the program administrators, in one of Harvard’s 8 affiliated hospitals and research centers (.
see maps of community.
).
Program Overview.
The HSCI summer internship program (HIP) for undergraduates is an 8-week experience dedicated to hands-on research in the laboratory of an HSCI faculty member.
 The program is an open door; an invitation to learn and do as much as you can to develop your own interests within the overarching topic of stem cell science.
 Our interns arrive from a wide variety of colleges and universities worldwide.
 Some have extensive prior academic and research experience with stem cell science while others have little or even none at all.
 This diversity is part of what makes our program rich and unique but also presents occasional challenges as some students are perhaps further along than others are in certain areas.

Background.
In the decades ahead, the pace of biomedical discovery will continue to accelerate.
 The state of an individual will be characterized with increasing precision from the molecular level to genomic parameters to the organ level and for interactions with medications, nutrients, the microbiome, therapeutic devices, and the environment.
 The size and complexity of high-dimensional characterization of patients will lead to far more complex diagnostic and prognostic categories than are currently in use.
 The multivariate descriptors of large populations will allow stratification of kinds only seen in the most recent genomically-informed clinical trials.
 Complex, but empirically validated, algorithms will be embedded in electronic health record systems as decision support tools to assist in everyday patient care.
 Those management algorithms will evolve and be modified continuously based on inputs from ongoing clinical experience and from new research.
 Whether developing basic computational methods, modeling molecular mechanisms, or engineering new clinical applications,.
students with a quantitative orientation and love of data analytics will be the future engineers of innovation in biomedicine.
.
If you are an undergraduate with a strong quantitative background and interested in innovation and methodological rigor in your approach to scientific inquiry in biomedicine or in the translation of computational methods to engineering/software applications in medicine, this is the summer program for you.
.
Please note that this is.
not.
a program for students seeking a summer research experience in order to enhance your competitiveness for entry to medical school.
.
History.
The Summer Institute was initially supported (2004-2014) by the NIH-funded i2b2 National Center for Biomedical Computing (NCBC) and then by NIH-funded BD2K (Big Data to Knowledge) program (2015-2020).
 The program is now fully based at the HMS Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).
 It was previously also known as the Summer Scholars in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (Summer BIG) and the Harvard–MIT/HST Summer Bioinformatics Program.
.
DBMI gratefully acknowledges the role its partners at the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology have played in sustaining this successful program for its first 13 years.

Ernst Mayr Travel Grants.
Apply for an Ernst Mayr Grant.
The MCZ awards travel grants for research in animal systematics, known as the Ernst Mayr Grants.
 The principal objective of these grants is to stimulate taxonomic work on neglected taxa via short visits to museums in order to undertake research needed for the completion of taxonomic revisions and monographs.
 These include taxa with numerous poorly described species, genera and families known to have many undescribed species in institutional collections, taxa for which it is unknown what proportion of the nominal species are synonyms and difficult genera without keys.
 It is not the aim of these grants to support largely phylogenetic studies of taxa in which the species are reasonably well known, or to support biogeographic studies.
 Preference is given to studies that use the MCZ's collections.
and to researchers who wish to examine MCZ specimens from their country of origin.
, although applications to work at other museums will be considered.
 There is enough demand for this support for taxonomic work to make it impossible to also support phylogenetic and other evolutionary studies from the Ernst Mayr Grants.
.
Typical expenses that may be paid from these grants include travel, lodging, and meals for up to a few weeks while conducting research at the museum(s), reasonable services purchased from the host institution and research supplies.
.
The maximum award is $2,500.
.
 Local recipients will receive a check from the Bank of America and foreign nationals will receive funds by a wire transfer to their bank.
.
Due to current regulations, foreign nationals traveling to the United States will not receive funds in advance of travel.
.
.
Eligibility.
This grant is open to all.
.
Application.
Applications must be submitted electronically through.
CARAT.
(Centralized Application for Research and Travel).
 You can begin your work, save it, and return to it at a later time.
.
Applications (including all supporting documents) are due by 5 pm EST on the due date.
.
To apply, please submit the following via CARAT:.
a short project description and explicit statement of research goals, not to exceed 2 pages.
itinerary.
budget.
curriculum vitae, not to exceed 2 pages.
three letters of support.
letter or email from each collection to be visited.
Deadlines.
Proposals are reviewed twice a year; application deadlines are October 15 and April 1.
 Awards typically will be announced within two months following the application deadline.
 Each grantee is required to submit a written report summarizing the scientific accomplishments achieved with the award within one month of travel completion.

Professor Shiu-Ying Hu (1910-2012).
made innumerable and important contributions to botanical science through her vast knowledge, collecting activities and research, writings and publications, and tireless personal devotion to the plant kingdom.
 In a career that spanned more than seven decades, she made her mark in the field of plant taxonomy as Emeritus Senior Research Fellow of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University and Honorary Professor of Chinese Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
 An internationally-recognized authority on Ilex (hollies), Hemerocaulis (daylilies), Paulownia, Compositae (daisies), and Orchidaceae (orchids), Professor Hu collected and identified as many as 185,000 plant specimens and published more than 160 papers over the course of her lifetime.
.
Professor Hu’s work as a researcher and teacher inspired multiple generations of botanical students around the world, particularly those interested in the flora of her native China and its disjunct companion species in North America.
 As the steward of one of the world’s premiere collections of Chinese plants (held outside of Asia), the Arnold Arboretum served as a focal training ground for Shiu-Ying Hu after she became the first Chinese woman to earn a doctorate in botany from Harvard University.
 Her critical contributions to the beginnings of the Flora of China Project under the guidance of Arboretum Director Richard Howard not only inaugurated her career but produced the first volume in a project that today engages more than 600 scientists from around the world in preparing individual treatments.
 The recipient of numerous awards and honors during her lifetime, Professor Shiu-Ying Hu will be honored as a scientist and teacher in perpetuity by the Arnold Arboretum through an endowed fund to award emerging scientists who wish to follow her example of diligence and scholarship.

Summer Short Courses in Organismic Plant Biology.
Summer short courses in organismic plant biology bring distinguished faculty,  a world-class living collection, and a state-of-the-art teaching microscopy laboratory together to give students from around the world an immersive learning experience.
 With the opportunity to bring molecular genetic and genomic tools to almost any clade of plants, a key challenge is linking comparative developmental genetics to existing bodies of knowledge; notably the two hundred year legacy of comparative developmental morphology and anatomy.
 Summer short courses provide vital analytical tools central to understanding the developmental bases for structural and functional diversity.
.
Summer Short Courses are free for all participants.
.
Summer Short Courses in organismic plant biology are sponsored by the.
Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.
, the.
Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
, and.
New Phytologist Trust.

Arnold Arboretum Genomics Initiative and Sequencing Award.
Applications are not currently being accepted for this award, but we encourage you to explore all the.
Arboretum Awards.
for genomic sequencing of important taxa.
.
As part of its.
Living Collections Campaign.
, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University has begun to create the first “genomic type collection” of plants in the world.
 This living collection will be the permanent home for sequenced living specimens of temperate woody taxa, available to all who wish to undertake research on the biology of these plants.
 The Arboretum envisions this collection to be a central resource for comparative genomics, developmental biology, whole plant physiology, phylogenetics, and plant responses to the environment.
.
In addition to growing germplasm of temperate woody plant taxa that have already been sequenced, the Arboretum promoted the development of additional genomic resources through competitive awards for.
de novo.
sequencing of important taxa within the Arboretum’s living collections.
.
The living collections of temperate woody plants at the Arnold Arboretum, numbering some 15,000 plants representing some 2,100 species, are distinguished as one of the most thoroughly documented in the world.
 Taxonomic diversity and breadth are noteworthy, and the floras of North America, China, Japan, and Korea are particularly well represented.

 In addition, each intern will spend time with the arborist crew, focusing on pruning skills, chainsaw use, and tree climbing.
 Applicants should have some experience in landscape maintenance and an interest in exploring career paths in public horticulture.
.
Arboriculture.
The arboriculture-focused experience is for those applicants exploring a career path as a.
climbing arborist.
.
 Interns spend their time working alongside the Arboretum’s arborists as they rotate through the collections evaluating plant health and assessing and executing the unique pruning needs of each specimen.
 This team works on large-scale plant removals, tree hazard assessments and corrective pruning measures, integrated pest management (IPM) practices, and other tasks as needed as part of the full horticultural operation.
 Applicants should have some experience in urban forestry or arboriculture and a basic working knowledge of aerial tree care, i.
e.
, climbing and lifts.
.
Plant Production.
Staff members at the Dana Greenhouses and Nursery propagate and grow all of the plant material that is eventually planted into the permanent collections of the Arboretum.
  Interns are introduced to the nursery and greenhouse production cycle and assist in watering, weeding, mulching, potting, and other jobs as required.
 The work varies from physical labor to technical work, with emphasis on proper growing methods.
 This internship also gives an overview of our accessioning and plant inventory process, including an introduction to.
BG-BASE.
(collections management software).
 Applicants should have some experience in plant propagation and/or greenhouse operations.
.
Curation.
The Curatorial Department administers record keeping and documentation projects for all living and legacy plant collections, directs acquisition and collection development initiatives, and facilitates the use of the collection by scholars.
 Of central importance is the annual inventory or field checking of roughly a fifth of the living collections.
 The curatorial intern spends the bulk of their time assisting staff in inventorying the living collections, which includes plant health assessments, mapping, and labeling.
 Additionally, time may be spent collecting voucher herbarium specimens representing Arboretum accessions, sorting herbarium specimens in the Herbarium of Cultivated Plants, entering archival data to curatorial databases, and generating reports and/or maps for visiting researchers.
 Interns will receive considerable training in.
BG-BASE.
(collections management software).
 Applicants are expected to have strong woody plant identification skills.
.
Expectations and Qualifications.
Interns selected for the Isabella Welles Hunnewell Internship Program are expected to participate fully in the work-life of the institution with maturity, punctuality, curiosity, and commitment to learning.
 Preference will be given to candidates who have at least some of the following qualifications:.
One or more years of education in horticulture, botany, landscape design, or other plant-related fields at a college, university.
Work experience in a nursery, greenhouse, garden center, park, arboretum, or botanical garden.
Career aspirations in public horticulture, botany, or another plant-related field.
Must have physical health and stamina to work in all weather conditions and to maintain a high level of productivity.
Maturity, self-motivation, and willingness to work as part of a team.

Research Opportunities.
Performing research can be a very enriching and transformative part of your undergraduate experience at the College.
 You may encounter it as part of your coursework, but it can also be something you do outside of the classroom as a way to gain practical skills, learn about methods of inquiry and contribute actively to the advancement of study in your field.
.
Finding a research opportunity will require you to be proactive, build.
faculty relationships.
, and use.
key resources.
.
 It may be good to start by charting your personal goals and interests in order to help you identify opportunities that are a match for them.
 Remember to give yourself plenty of time for your search and to remain flexible and open-minded through the process.
 Engaging with the research community at Harvard is possible for students in all concentrations.
 Whether you have participated in research work previously, or are just getting started, there are opportunities designed to meet you where you are right now.
.
Research opportunities come in many formats and happen in a variety of settings.
 They often start off as a question that someone wants to explore more fully.
 Faculty, for example, initiate research projects designed for this purpose.
 It might also begin with you! In your studies, for example, you may have noticed a lack of knowledge or a lack of recent work on a particular topic that interests you.
 With the guidance of a faculty mentor, you could be the person to explore and find answers to fill in the void of missing information.
.
Depending on the scale of a project, you might find yourself working on a team or operating on your own and coordinating your efforts with those of a faculty mentor.
 This work may take place on campus, at other domestic locations, or even internationally, during term-time or over the course of the summer.
.
Some common formats of research experiences for undergraduates include:.
Course-based Research.
Courses (existing or independent study).
 Many courses at Harvard and neighboring institutions (where you can.
cross-register.
) have a strong research component.
 There is even the option for you to design an independent study course.
 To explore these options, the best starting point is with a concentration adviser knowledgeable about course offerings and policies in that concentration.
 You can also visit the.
Advising Programs Office.
(APO) to connect with undergraduate concentration advisers.
.
Research Assistantships.
There are many opportunities to work as a research assistant on an existing project.
 A research assistantship is an excellent opportunity for students with little experience to get their first exposure to research.
 Research assistantship postings can be found on department webpages, at research centers, as well as on the Student Employment Office.
Job Board.
.
 You can also check with nearby hospitals and research groups, in addition to faculty and grad students.
 If you have never contacted research investigators before, check out our tips on how to effectively.
reach out to faculty.
.
.
Research Programs.
In lieu of performing research via a course or an assistantship, you might consider looking at a research program.
 Depending on the program, you might work on a project designed by a member of faculty or propose your own question to pursue under the guidance of a faculty mentor.
 URAF summer programs, for example, are designed to correspond to specific academic areas (i.
e.
, STEM, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences), forming a cohort of fellows working on various topics in their area of interest.
.
URAF research programs are offered on an annual basis, with pre-set start- and end-times, and require formal applications with strict deadlines.
 These programs often have different eligibility criteria (i.
e.
, GPA, class year, research experience).
 Some programs require previous field-specific experience, while other are designed for newcomers to that particular field of study.
 Many research programs include various forms of financial support (e.
g.
 stipends, accommodation, etc.
) as well as opportunities for community-building and intellectual growth.
.
Thesis Research.
Each concentration has its own requirements for thesis research, including topics allowed, prerequisites, timing, and who can supervise your work.
 If you are interested in thesis research, connect with advisers appointed by the concentrations for guiding undergraduates—information about.
concentration advisers.
can be found on the APO website.
 Also, check out our tips on how to effectively.
reach out to faculty.
.
.
Some questions to ask yourself when looking for a program are:.
Where do you want to be?.
What type of research would you like to do?.
Does the program offer additional support or programming that may be helpful?.
How long do you intend to do research?.
The.
Browse URAF opportunities.
page of our website aggregates a large number of Harvard undergraduate research options.
 Please note, however, that not all Harvard-affiliated schools and programs are listed here.
 To ensure you are learning about all potential opportunities, don’t forget to consult faculty advisers, concentration advisers, and academic advisers to identify programs that match your interests and desired outcomes most closely.
.
Beyond browsing through URAF opportunities, you can explore our.
External Resources.
page which provides another starting point for finding research opportunities, including research programs.
 Some are based at Harvard, while others are located across the US and worldwide.
 You can also use Google to search for research programs related to your topic and interests.
 Try using the keywords, "undergraduate research" or "summer undergraduate research.
".
If you have previously performed research at Harvard, you too might consider how you would benefit from.
exploring external opportunities.
.
 Exposure to research and processes at different institutions will allow you to expand your professional and academic networks, to explore a new place and even new ways of investigating topics that interest you.
.
At whatever point you happen to be in your undergraduate trajectory, URAF is here to support you through each stage of the process.

More on the Student Advisory Board.
Being a part of Harvard Radcliffe Institute has been one of the defining moments in my Harvard journey.
 Being a part of the Student Advisory Board has provided me the opportunity to step outside my own box and helped me become a better leader in the process.
 When students from across multiple disciplines come together to share ideas over coffee and conversation, brilliant ideas are born.
.

More on the Student Advisory Board.
Working at Radcliffe is a great way to build research skills and meaningful relationships.
 I think that's the most important part of this, building these relationships that hopefully you'll take with you even when you leave Harvard.

More on the Radcliffe Research Partnership program.
Harvard Radcliffe Institute has been a huge part of my College experience.
 I first started working there as a research assistant to a fellow who was studying NOW [the National Organization for Women].
 Then I was on the student advisory board, and now I’m working with Emerging Leaders.
 It’s a wonderful way to work with the Institute outside the realm of research, and it feels really good to be giving back to the wider community.
.
Lauren Fadiman ’21.
Former Emerging Leaders Program mentor.
More on the Emerging Leaders Program.
I loved the idea that Harvard Radcliffe Institute—with its mission and legacy and the resources collected in the Schlesinger Library—was experimenting with new programs and trying to rethink how it can bridge different communities.

Stars have winds.
 A star’s motion, with its wind, creates a cocoon or a sac—an “astrosphere”—and our Sun’s cocoon is known as the heliosphere.
 The heliosphere shelters our solar system from the interstellar medium and its radiation known as galactic cosmic rays.
 Recently, geologists discovered extraterrestrial radioactive isotopes on Earth that could only have come from outside our heliosphere.
 How and when were we exposed?
 
Today, Nature Astronomy published “A Possible Direct Exposure of the Earth to the Cold Dense Interstellar Medium 2–3 Myr Ago.
” In this video, the lead author, Merav Opher, discusses her team’s discovery that 2–3 million years ago the heliosphere appears to have been dramatically compressed, which would have forced the Earth out of its protective sac, leaving it exposed.

 
The Earth’s exposure almost certainly had a substantial impact on our planet and its climate.
 This research indicates that there is good reason to explore whether this expulsion from the heliosphere affected the Earth’s ancient climate.
 This could well be the explanation for a range of phenomena, including ice ages, diversification of species, and the extinction of dinosaurs.

 
Opher is a professor of astronomy at Boston University and the 2021–2022 William Bentinck-Smith Fellow and a 2024 summer fellow at Harvard Radcliffe Institute, where much of this work was done.

 
For more information about this exciting discovery, head over to our Linktree to read an article in the Harvard Gazette.

Summer Research Opportunities for Undergraduates.
Summer is a great time to get involved in research, whether it's in a field you intend to study seriously, or in one you just want to try out.
 There are many opportunities for funding, as you'll see below, and you are encouraged to take advantage of these.
 Note that most REU application deadlines run from.
mid January to early March.
, so you should get started in early January (or late in the fall semester if some of the early deadlines mentioned below are relevant).
.
In addition to being a fun way to spend your summer, a research job will (1) allow you to learn lots of things, (2) give you a flavor of what grad school and industry are like, if these are in your plans, and (3) allow various scientists to get to know you and your work, which is always a good thing (actually, a necessary thing) when it comes time to obtain letters of recommendation.
.
Some programs require you to have completed your sophomore or junior year, but there are also plenty that are available for freshmen.
 So if you're interested in doing research, there's no excuse for not getting started early.
 Start searching around, an join in the fun!.
Your summer research can be funded in five basic ways.
 The funds may come from:.
An REU program (this money comes from the NSF).
.
Other organized programs that aren't REUs.
.
The Physics Department.
.
Various Harvard fellowships/programs.
.
A specific faculty member (that is, from internal lab funds).
.
In more detail, these five basic ways to get funding are:.
REU Programs:.
Professors throughout the country can apply for "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF).
 Undergraduates in turn can apply to these programs for the opportunity to do summer research.
 There are many programs in a variety of scientific fields.
 The application deadlines generally run from mid January to early March.
 The webpage with the list of all the existing programs is:.
NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.
There are lots and lots of fields listed here, including Physics, Materials Research, Astronomy, Chemistry, Computer Science, Biology, and many more.
 So don't just look at the Physics ones! Programs are sometimes added late to the list, so check it periodically for changes.
.
Non-REU Programs:.
There are many other programs that are funded by various departments/agencies/schools, but that are not REUs.
 Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive list of these, but emails are occasionally sent to the SPS list.
 Here's a list of some websites (if you know of any other non-REU programs like these, please let David Morin know!).
Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI) at National Labs, funded by DOE.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
DOE Scholars Program.
Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) and other programs.
Perimeter Scholars International.
Summer Research Opportunities at Harvard (SROH).
Summer Internship Programs at Fermilab.
Research Internships in Science and Engineering (in Germany).
NIST SURF.
NASA Internships.
Lincoln Labs/MIT.
Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.
Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astonomy.
Wolfram Research (Mathematica).
National Security Agency.
NCAR Computational Science.
Mignone Center for Career Success.
The Harvard Physics Department.
has some funds available for summer research on campus.
 The deadline for applying is Sunday, March 24, 2024.
 David Morin will send out a link to the application in mid March.
.
The basic strategy for finding a professor and forming a proposal is to look around for a few professors whose work interests you, and to then start knocking on doors and sending out emails.
 Informal, but effective.
 See this list of the.
Physics faculty.
, and also this list organized by.
Research area.
.
.
These funds are limited, which means that the larger the number of students who stay on campus, the smaller the funding amount will be.
 You are therefore encouraged to apply to REU programs.
 If you don't have a specific reason to stay at Harvard over the summer, it would be a shame to ignore the mindboggling number of REUs out there.
 If you decide to decline them in favor of a lab here at Harvard, that's fine.
 But for one summer, you may want to take advantage of the opportunity to explore things and visit another university.
 Travel around the world, see interesting places and people, and do physics.
 One caveat: If you are planning on going to physics grad school, you should definitely spend at least one summer here at Harvard (perhaps two), bookended with one or two 90r's before and/or after, to have an extended period of time for your research.
.
If you do reseach here at Harvard with Physics Dept funding, your overall funding will likely come from a combination of sources: Physics Dept, HCRP, and internal lab funds.
.
Harvard has various other souces of funding.
.
There are many programs listed on the.
Undergraduate Research and Fellowships (URAF) page.
.
 In particular:.
1) The.
Harvard College Research Program.
is an important source of funding.
 Their deadline is also Sunday, March 24, 2024.
 To be eligible for Physics funding, you.
must.
apply to HCRP.
.
2) The.
PRISE.
Program offers housing along with social and educational events.
 You are.
strongly encouraged.
to apply.
 The deadline is early: Tuesday, February 13, 2024.
.
3) You should also consider applying for the.
Herchel Smith Fellowship.
.
 The deadline is very early: Sunday, February 4, 2024.
 This is a fantastic fellowship.
 If you get it, it basically takes care of all your summer-money worries.
.
4) If you are interested in going abroad, you should consider the.
Weissman.
Fellowship.
.
5) Other Harvard sources of funding can be found on the.
Office of Career Services.
page and on the above URAF page.
.
Internal lab funds:.
You can avoid all the above funding issues by going directly to a professor who happens to have some grant money available for undergraduate summer research.
 Some do, some don't.
 This strategy definitely requires some running around.
 But note well -- it would be very unwise to use only this strategy unless you have an early guarantee that it's going to work.
.
Contact.
David Morin.
if you have any questions.
 Good luck!!.

The National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) NSF funds a large number of research opportunities for undergraduate students through its REU Sites program.
 An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution.
 Each student is associated with a specific research project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other researchers.
 Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel.
 Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions.
 An REU Site may be at either the US or foreign location.
 By using the.
web page.
, search for an REU Site, you may examine opportunities in the subject areas supported by various NSF units.
 Also, you may search by keywords to identify sites in particular research areas or with certain features, such as a particular location.
 Students must contact the individual sites for information and application materials.
 NSF does not have application materials and does not select student participants.
 A contact person and contact information are listed for each site.

How can we expand the limits of human knowledge further into the unknown? The Center for Astrophysics is a collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard College Observatory that’s designed to ask big questions about the universe, build the tools needed to answer them, and share the resulting discoveries with the world.
.
"The coming decade will be an extremely exciting time for astrophysics with the next generation space- and ground-based telescopes being built and coming on-line.
 The CfA's strength is the  expertise of its scientists and researchers across the full electromagnetic spectrum from the X-rays through to the radio and sub-mm.
 This year, we are developing a 10-year scientific strategic plan to answer some of astronomy's biggest questions.
  Our work with the Smithsonian to develop nationwide education and outreach programs will bring astronomy to school kids across America.

Neutron Stars and White Dwarfs.
When stars die, their fate is determined by how massive they were in life.
 Stars like our Sun leave behind white dwarfs: Earth-size remnants of the original star’s core.
 More massive stars explode as supernovas, while their cores collapse into neutron stars: ultra-dense, fast-spinning spheres made of the same ingredients as the nucleus of an atom.
 At least some neutron stars are pulsars, which produce powerful beams of light, which as they sweep across our view from Earth look like extremely regular flashes.
.
Small as they are, the deaths of these compact objects change the chemistry of the universe.
 The supernova explosions of white dwarfs and the collisions of neutron stars create new elements on the periodic table.
 For all these reasons, white dwarfs and neutron stars are important laboratories for physics at the extremes of strong gravity, density, and temperature.

 I am a Illinois Math and Science Academy alumna where I completed and published research on the motivational factors of gifted and talented Black and Latino students engaged in STEM.
 I am currently doing biomedical research on the toxicity mechanisms of tau oligomers in Alzheimer’s Disease at Hampton University, and previously did summer research at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine on finding substrates of UBE3A with intentions of understanding Angelman Syndrome and related neurodevelopmental disorders.
 Ultimately, I hope to own a neuroscience research facility where I can provide nonconventional opportunities producing STEM and biomedical research education initiatives for underrepresented students.
.
In my free time, I enjoys basking in nature, learning and experiencing new things, admiring and engaging in all forms of art, reading books of many genres, conversing with friends, and volunteering as a tutor and mentor of underrepresented students.

April Lee -.
Haigis Lab.
I am currently a junior at Cornell University completing a degree in Biology, with a concentration in Molecular and Cellular Biology.
 I grew up in Sudbury, Massachusetts where I attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, though I am currently residing in Alpharetta, Georgia.
 I first realized that I wished to pursue the field of molecular and cellular biology during my biology class sophomore year of high school.
 Since then, I have tried to be as involved in and learn as much about biology as I can, whether that be through taking interesting biology classes at college or spending the vast majority of my free time in lab.
 I have held two research positions prior to this program.
 One was in the Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Biomaterials at Brigham and Women’s Hospital where I conducted research on nanoparticles containing anti-cancer drugs.
 The other was part of my undergraduate studies in Cornell’s Department of Molecular Medicine using both classic molecular techniques and structural biology to analyze the function of various proteins.
 In this lab I’ve successfully purified, crystalized and obtained the structure of the active site-containing domain of an endonuclease, which revealed its catalytic mechanism.
 I was also heavily involved in solving the structure and mechanism of the DNA binding domain of another protein.
 I am very interested in studying the molecular mechanisms behind cellular functions and pathways, especially in terms of cellular aging and disease.
 When I am not spending my time in class or in the lab, I enjoy being an active executive member of Alpha Chi Sigma, a professor chemistry fraternity, and captaining the Alpha Chi Sigma intramural soccer team that I founded.
 I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball, softball and horseback riding when possible.
 I love cell biology and hope to continue to study and research it as much as I can!.

I was born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico and immigrated to the United States at the age of 12.
 I a first-generation college student at San Diego State University double-majoring in cellular and molecular biology, and Spanish, with a minors in chemistry, counseling, and social change.
 During my time at San Diego State, I have joined 11 honor societies, been an active member of five campus organizations, and contributed countless hours to volunteer work with underserved populations.
 I have maintained a 3.
94 GPA while conducting laboratory research at San Diego State, interning at the UCSD Medical Center, mentoring middle and high school students, and serving as a STEM ambassador for local youth.
 After graduation I plan to complete an M.
D.
/Ph.
D.
 program focusing on oncology research to prepare for a career teaching at the university level, while conducting clinical research in the biomedical sciences.
 I enjoy hiking, reading, and serving my community through mentorship, tutoring, and by providing free health care services through different on-campus organizations.

Nathaniel Rolfe -.
Shi Lab.
I grew up in San Marino, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.
  I am the only child of two international bankers, one specializing in Asia and the other in Latin America.
  In elementary school, I became engrossed in baseball and developed into a Red Sox fan, due to my father’s roots in Boston.
  At the age of 12, my passion for baseball would lead to a slipped vertebra, which would have to be surgically fused.
  During my recovery from the surgery, I became immersed in physics, a passion that morphed into an interest for almost every branch of science.
  It was during my time spent in the hospital that I began to entertain the idea that I might one day become a medical researcher.
  As I entered high school, I returned to the baseball field while continuing my studies in science.
  In 2015, I began studying at Haverford College and joined Haverford College’s cricket team, the only varsity cricket team in the United States.
  While the undergraduate years are, undeniably, a time of change, my love for the natural sciences, and in particular for biology, has only grown during my time at Haverford, and cricket has proved to be an interesting alternative to baseball.

.
Margaret Weber -.
Shi Lab.
I am from Pittsburgh, PA and am currently a sophomore at Middlebury College.
 My interests lie at the intersection of medicine and research.
 I am fascinated by the complexities of biological processes including tumor growth, genetics, and infectious diseases.
 Additionally, I was fascinated to find aspects of research such as problem solving and reasoning to also be applicable to multifaceted global issues.
 My fascination in global issues has led me to present at a conference in Qatar, study the Holocaust in Poland, and implement a fundraiser to buy a solar panel for a school in rural Nepal.
 My travels and experiences have given me a unique view of the world and have influenced my desire to use my passion for medicine to help others.
 Next fall, I am hoping to travel to India, South Africa, and Brazil to study global health.
 My passion for both the sciences and international studies led me to a liberal arts college where I can pursue both interests through a Molecular Biology and Biochemistry major and a prospective South Asia Studies minor.
 Outside of the classroom, my hobbies include painting, charcoal drawing, hiking, and rock climbing.

Background.
In the decades ahead, the pace of biomedical discovery will continue to accelerate.
 The state of an individual will be characterized with increasing precision from the molecular level to genomic parameters to the organ level and for interactions with medications, nutrients, the microbiome, therapeutic devices, and the environment.
 The size and complexity of high-dimensional characterization of patients will lead to far more complex diagnostic and prognostic categories than are currently in use.
 The multivariate descriptors of large populations will allow stratification of kinds only seen in the most recent genomically-informed clinical trials.
 Complex, but empirically validated, algorithms will be embedded in electronic health record systems as decision support tools to assist in everyday patient care.
 Those management algorithms will evolve and be modified continuously based on inputs from ongoing clinical experience and from new research.
 Whether developing basic computational methods, modeling molecular mechanisms, or engineering new clinical applications,.
students with a quantitative orientation and love of data analytics will be the future engineers of innovation in biomedicine.
.
If you are an undergraduate with a strong quantitative background and interested in innovation and methodological rigor in your approach to scientific inquiry in biomedicine or in the translation of computational methods to engineering/software applications in medicine, this is the summer program for you.
.
Please note that this is.
not.
a program for students seeking a summer research experience in order to enhance your competitiveness for entry to medical school.
.
History.
The Summer Institute was initially supported (2004-2014) by the NIH-funded i2b2 National Center for Biomedical Computing (NCBC) and then by NIH-funded BD2K (Big Data to Knowledge) program (2015-2020).
 The program is now fully based at the HMS Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).
 It was previously also known as the Summer Scholars in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (Summer BIG) and the Harvard–MIT/HST Summer Bioinformatics Program.
.
DBMI gratefully acknowledges the role its partners at the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology have played in sustaining this successful program for its first 13 years.

Rosenkrantz Travel Grants.
This grant program is exclusively for concentrators in History and Science.
  It allows motivated rising juniors  (who have completed sophomore tutorial) and who are concentrating in history and science to devise a short but meaningful plan of travel and academic discovery in the United States or abroad.
 This grant program may serve as the first stage of research towards a senior thesis or junior research paper, but there is no requirement that it do so.
 The only requirement is a sincere passion for adventure and exploration, and a willingness to prepare well for the experience.

 Each student is assigned to a specific MGH laboratory, clinical site, health policy, or health services research area where they undertake an original research project under the mentorship and guidance of a Mass General Hospital (MGH) investigator.
 Assignments are carefully considered and are made with the student's research and career interests in mind.
 In addition to this unique research experience, students will gain knowledge through weekly didactic seminars, both at the MGH and at Harvard Medical School, attend career development workshops and networking event, and have opportunities for clinical shadowing.

Rosenkrantz Travel Grants.
PLEASE NOTE: The Rosenkrantz Travel Grant program is currently inactive.
.
Named in honor of the late Professor Barbara Rosenkrantz, a pioneering historian of public health and a great supporter of undergraduate research, this grant program is exclusively for concentrators in History and Science.
  It allows motivated rising juniors  (who have completed sophomore tutorial) and who are concentrating in history and science to devise a short but meaningful plan of travel and academic discovery in the United States or abroad.
 This grant program may serve as the first stage of research towards a senior thesis or junior research paper, but there is no requirement that it do so.
 The only requirement is a sincere passion for adventure and exploration, and a willingness to prepare well for the experience.
.
Travel lasting between 5-10 days can be supported to: tour a city rich with sites associated with the history of science, medicine or technology; visit a library with unique holdings or archives related to the history of science, medicine, or technology; assist on a project or do independent open-ended research in museum collections relevant to the history of science, medicine, or technology; retrace the journey of a key individual or group important in the history of science, medicine or technology, or something else again.
 In 2016, the program sent concentrators to Brazil, Iceland, Hungary and Austria, Norway, Washington D.
C.
, England, Mexico, and Cuba!.
Read about their adventures here!.
The Director of Undergraduate Studies and all other faculty are available to help students shape projects.
 Normally, the amount of funds awarded will not be less than $750 or greater than $2000, and usually will fall somewhere in between.
  Recipients are expected to contribute to a.
group blog.
over the course of their travels, and to file a brief report after they return.
 They may also be invited to meet with the donor over lunch during the fall semester following their travels.
.
Take a look at the group blog from the summer of 2017!.
And this is the group blog for the summer of 2018.

 Predicting pathogenicity of non-coding variants.
Non-coding regions make up the majority of the genome and house thousands of variants associated with human disease.
 When non-coding variants are identified in genomics studies, identifying whether these variants are actually causal or simply in linkage disequilibrium with the causal variants is difficult.
 Existing methods to prioritize non-coding variants generally rely on training convolutional neural networks on epigenetic data, and fail to identify variants that may function in biological contexts for which no such data exist.
 There is a need for models that can uncover pathogenic non-coding variants associated with heritable traits and diseases irrespective of the available high-throughput regulatory sequencing studies.
 Our lab is looking for interested candidates to join our team in applying modeling approaches from evolutionarily-informed generative models for proteins to non-coding regions such as promoters to accurately predict the pathogenicity of non-coding variants.
.
Skills Required: python coding and biology background.
Skills to be gained: bioinformatics with large datasets of human sequences and evolutionary sequences, deep learning modeling (pytorch), human genetics.
Questions about the position can be directed to project mentor,.

 Models for pandemic preparedness using pre-pandemic evolutionary data.
The Marks Lab has worked on predicting viral antibody escape from pre-pandemic data and designing proteins for vaccine development.
 While current vaccine design and testing strategies rely only on currently-circulating variants, our model provides early warning to allow for vaccine development before a new variant appears.
 Our lab designs variants that mimic the neutralizability of future pandemic variation, transforming the way vaccines should be evaluated, and our model can be used to computationally design variant-proof vaccines.
 Our team is looking for interested candidates to develop new machine learning models on evolutionary protein sequences and structures to aid in further pandemic preparedness efforts, including epitope prediction, and protein design for vaccine testing and development.

Undergraduate Research Opportunity, Role of clotting factors in oral mucosal diseases, Oral Medicine, Infection, and Immunity; Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Posted March 12, 2024.
.
PI: Lakmali M Silva,.
Website.
Longwood campus, In-person opportunity.
Our lab work on understanding how clotting factors mediate immune responses at the mucosal barrier sites.
 Mucosal barriers are the first encounters of a myriad of insults, including microbial, physical, and environmental factors that lead to damage.
 This damage can activate the coagulation cascade at the mucosa, which works in a hand-in-a-hand relationship with the inflammatory system to repair the damage and restore balance.
 However, we know very little about how these two systems work at a molecular level.
 Therefore, we aim to understand how different clotting factors contribute to mucosal inflammation, especially at the oral mucosa.
 We mainly use genetically-modified mice to understand how these clotting factors mediate inflammation and state-of-the-art immunological techniques to determine the inflammatory responses due to genetic mutations.
.
We would be delighted to have motivated individuals joining our lab to learn research approaches, and participate in ongoing projects.

Neural mechanism of Cognitive flexibility and the role of dopamine, Molecular & Cellular Biology, FAS, Posted March 12, 2024.

PI: Naoshige Uchida,.
Website.
Cambridge campus, In-Person opportunity.
The Uchida lab is primarily interested in neural basis of decision making and value updating.
 How do know what is valuable? How do we perform actions based on these values? How does the brain learn, store and use values to guide future decision? and how does this go awry in addiction, aging and various neuropsychiatric disorders? This project is aims to uncover principles that underlie how animals can build internal models of the environment to guide value estimation.
 We employ classical Pavlovian conditioning in mice, with odors as cues to test how mice learn the value of each stimulus, and vary the value of the cues dynamically to test if mice can infer the value of one cue based on the value of the other cue.
 We will use fiber-photometry to record dopamine release in the ventral striatum, and test specific predictions about how internal models are built in the brain.
 Furthermore, we will manipulate and record activity in regions like Orbital Frontal Cortex (OFC) and hippocampus, in order to understand the neural basis of cognitive flexibility.
 This work could have huge implication for understanding cognitive decline in aging, as well impaired ability to form internal models in mice models of autism.

Cambridge campus, In-person opportunity.
How do the brain and heart modulate each other’s function? The heart-brain communication axis is central to vertebrate health and survival.
 For example, when an animal perceives a threat, during its response the brain modulates heart function, and neural feedback from the heart modulates brain activity.
 We know that the intracardiac nervous system (ICNS), composed of all the heart neurons, communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and vice versa.
 However, our understanding of the neural control of cardiac function is limited to knowing some of the brain regions involved in the process; we do not understand the computations carried out by the neural circuits within and between the cardioregulatory areas of the CNS, ANS, and ICNS.
 Our team uses a multidisciplinary approach that combines control engineering, systems neuroscience, and genetics to uncover the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac control.
.
Who this project might be a good fit for, in terms of interests and/or goals:.
Ideal for students interested in pursuing a PhD or MD-PhD in any science or engineering field.

Undergraduate Research Opportunity, An Augmented Reality (AR) Smart Decisions Support System to Advance Trauma Care at the Point of Injury, Emergency Medicine, MGH, Harvard Medical School, Posted March 12, 2024.
.
.
PI: Ryan Harari,.
Website.
Longwood, Hybrid opportunity.
Despite advancements in trauma care, errors in prehospital treatment are common, resulting in poor patient outcomes.
 Telemedicine has emerged as a promising tool for delivering care in prehospital settings and has been shown to improve the quality of care provided.
 However, conventional telemedicine tools have significant limitations when it comes to delivering real-time support and guidance to providers in point-of-injury (POI) settings, where rapid response and informed decision-making are crucial.
 Moreover, POI settings often require specialized equipment and expertise, which may not be available in conventional telemedicine setups.
.
With Stepping Strong Center funding, Ryan Harari, PhD, and his team plan to develop and test an augmented reality (AR)-based telemonitoring support system, which will aid real-time decision-making and procedural guidance to healthcare providers in challenging online and offline POI settings.
 The team will leverage the AR-Coach system, which was developed in previous NASA-supported projects, to create an AR telemonitoring system.
 By incorporating both online telemonitoring for real-time support and an offline interactive checklist based on best practices, the team aims to improve clinical practices in trauma care in civilian and military applications, leading to less death, and reducing the cost burdens on healthcare systems.
.
Activities: - Literature review and reviewing medical scenarios to be used for development of AR technology.
- IRB protocol/Data collection/analysis.
- Manuscript drafting.
Who this project might be a good fit for, in terms of interests and/or goals:.
Student(s) who are curious and have passion to learn about medical AR/VR technologies and evaluating their effectiveness in supporting clinicians.
.
Hours per week.

Undergraduate Reserach Opportunity, Deciphering the genetic and epigenetic interaction network of neurodevelopmental disorders genes, MGH, Posted March 12, 2024.
.
PI: Sudhir Thakurela,.
Thakurela Lab.
.
Charlestown, In-Person opportunity.
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) encompass a diverse group of conditions characterized by atypical development of the brain and nervous system.
 These disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia, affect millions of individuals worldwide, causing significant challenges and impacting their quality of life.
 While the exact causes of NDDs remain largely unknown, accumulating evidence suggests a complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors.
 Genetic studies have identified numerous genes associated with NDD risk, often involving mutations or variations that disrupt their function.
 However, the specific mechanisms by which these genetic alterations contribute to NDDs are often unclear.
 Promoters and enhancers, the regulatory elements of the genome, act as crucial players in this process by directly influencing gene expression through direct interactions via chromatin looping.
 Alterations in the epigenetic landscape, such as modifications to enhancer activity or mutations in promoters, can significantly impact gene expression and potentially contribute to NDD development.
 Studies have traditionally focused on either genetic or epigenetic factors in isolation.
 These studies provide gene-specific details but do not reveal how genetic and epigenetic elements interact to regulate the NDD genes.
 Hence, the crucial information regarding the complete interaction network of the gene of interest remains concealed.
 Strategies that can interrogate and identify genome-wide activators or repressors of the NDD genes will provide hitherto unavailable resources to understand the fundamental gene regulatory network and provide novel intervention points to design new therapeutic targets.

Undergraduate Research Opportunity, Cognition during sleep, Mass Eye & Ear, Posted December 13, 2023.
.
Project Description:.
A new project at Mass Eye &amp; Ear hospital aims to understand the cognition that occurs during sleep.
 Though sleep is often considered a time of disconnect from the outside world, in reality we continuously analyze our environment as we sleep.
 Sounds are particularly useful for analyzing the nature and proximity of threats or other important events, to aid in determining whether we should wake up.
 For example, people tend to wake up more readily when hearing their own name, versus other sounds.
 Other stimuli may not wake us up, but still impact sleep architecture, for example making it more likely that we will enter REM sleep versus non-REM sleep.
.
People with hearing disorders often complain of poor sleep, but the underlying causes are unknown.
 We will perform quantitative videography and neural recordings in mice to determine (1) how hearing loss impacts sleep; (2) how normal-hearing mice analyze the sound environment while sleeping; and (3) how.
sound can be used as an intervention to alter sleep architecture and/or augment restorative brain activity during sleep.
.
Undergraduate researchers will assist in analyzing video data of mice to determine whether and how mouse behavior changes when hearing sound in sleep.
 This analysis will be performed using a toolkit based on deep learning to extract behavioral motifs like scanning the environment, escaping or freezing.
 Behavioral analysis will be combined with analysis of neural activity to determine how neurons extract relevant information from sound during sleep to guide subsequent waking behavior.
.
The ideal candidate would have experience in computer science or related fields, with an interest in applying machine learning techniques to neuroscience questions.

org/people/sol-schulman-md-phd/.
About this opportunity:.
Tissue factor (TF) binds blood coagulation factor VII/VIIa to initiate blood coagulation in humans.
 Inappropriate TF procoagulant activity underlies substantial human suffering, including that due to myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, cancer-associated thrombosis, stroke, and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.
 TF expression and activity must therefore be carefully regulated in vascular tissues to enable hemostasis following injury but prevent pathologic thrombosis.
 Despite decades of close investigation, the mechanisms by which TF expression and procoagulant activity are regulated on the vascular cell surface remain incompletely understood.
 We combine functional genomics, human and rodent genetics, cell biology, and protein biochemistry to dissect the TF-dependent initiation of blood coagulation.
 Because the contribution of cellular TF is not captured by clinical coagulation testing, these critical modifiers of human bleeding and thrombotic risk remain undetected in human populations.

Research Opportunity in Computational Neuroscience, Jenks Vestibular Lab, Mass Eye and Ear, Posted March 22, 2023.
.
The Jenks Vestibular Lab at Mass Eye and Ear seeks a biomedical engineering/bioengineering undergraduate student interested in computational neuroscience.
 In particular, the lab has projects focused on developing computational and mathematical models that study the effects of neural noise on different vestibular behaviors.
 The vestibular system, often called the sixth sense, is vital for relaying motion cues to the brain.
 These motion cues, being rotational velocities and linear accelerations, are essential for spatial orientation, postural control, and perception of gravity.
 However, like all the other sensory systems, vestibular cues to the brain are corrupted by neural noise, which has behavioral consequences.
 For example, neural noise has a role in postural sway, dizziness, disorientation, and vestibular disorders such as vestibular migraine and vertigo.
.
This research role provides challenging learning opportunities and close mentorship from Dr.
 Faisal Karmali, an expert in computational neuroscience specializing in the vestibular system.
 Highly self-motivated students eager to improve their computational skillset are encouraged to apply.

Project description.
and duties:.
The Kory lab in the Department of Molecular Metabolism at the Harvard T.
H.
 Chan School of Public Health focuses on mitochondria, critical organelles in metabolism that generate both energy and precursors for biosynthesis.
 Beyond their metabolic roles, mitochondria are being recognized as important signaling hubs and mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging and age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration, cancer, and diabetes.
 For mitochondria to function properly metabolites must be efficiently exchanged with the rest of the cell in a regulated manner.
 While metabolites can diffuse through pores in the outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to most metabolites and separates two chemically contrasting environments.
 We want to understand how mitochondria achieve efficient metabolite exchange and at the same time maintain the unique chemical environment of the mitochondrial matrix.
.
Our goal is to use mitochondrial transport proteins as tools to interrogate metabolic and signaling pathways to understand how mitochondria perform their multifaceted functions.
.
Current projects address:.
• How is mitochondrial metabolite flux adjusted to proliferative demand and cell function?.
• What role does the mitochondrial NAD pool play in the development of aging and age-associated disease?.
• How are metabolic processes inside mitochondria, such as TCA cycle, electron transport chain and one-carbon metabolism coordinated with cytosolic metabolism?.
• What are the roles of mitochondrial metabolites in metabolic signaling, quality control, communication and regulation of physiology?.
• How can dietary modifications be harnessed to improve mitochondrial health in aging?.
The student will be working closely with Dr.
 Kory, postdoctoral fellows and research scientists and in the lab to conduct experiments, prepare reagents, discuss research and analyze and present data.

Resume Template & Proposal Tips.
SCIENCE RESUME TEMPLATES.
Resume is the first document that will portray you before professors.
 Please follow detailed instructions and template below, so that your science resume would showcase your education and research/work/volunteer experiences.
 Note, that science resume.
format is different from the industry resume formats available through the Harvard Office of Career Services.
.
Freshman Resume.
Sophomore Resume.
FELLOWSHIP PROPOSALS.
Ideally you should have confirmed a lab position far enough ahead (end of Fall term-January) of the summer fellowship deadlines to allow time to meet with your principal investigator and lab mentor to discuss a project.
 This will help enormously as you prepare to write the research proposal for your fellowship applications (note, that research proposal requires several drafts before final document can be submitted).
 The more time you have to prepare drafts of your proposal and get feedback from your mentor, the stronger your application is likely to be.
 You may find it helpful to set up a timeline for submitting drafts to your mentor to ensure that they will have enough time to read and return them to you with comments before the deadline.
.
DO NOT LEAVE THIS UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.
.
 Your mentor may not have time to review your proposal if you send it to them the day before it is due.
.
Fellowship proposals have to be tailored to each specific fellowship application.
 Students are encouraged to read application instructions and include all required information in the specific format that each application requires, including word limit.
 Two common fellowship proposal guidelines are listed below.
.
Harvard College Research Program (HCRP):.
The HCRP application requires a 3-5 page detailed research proposal (see application instructions and make sure to include section headers and each item required for the proposal as well as.
proposal tips.
) and a letter of support from the lab principal investigator.
.
PRISE (Program for Research in Science and Engineering):.
PRISE fellows are expected to find their own research positions.
 However, students may apply to the program before having secured a lab position.
 PRISE research proposal limit is 500 words.
 Obviously, students who have not found a lab placement by the application deadline will not be in a position to write a specific project proposal; however, they are expected to submit an essay that broadly outlines their research interests.
 The selection committee allows some leeway in these instances as long as the essay has some scientific merit and makes a connection between the applicant’s research interests and academic goals.
 The selection committee expects a more detailed research proposal from students who already have found research positions.
 Your lab mentor can provide you with background material and work with you on your project proposal.
 Be sure to phrase the proposal in your own words and not use wording taken directly from lab publications or their web site.
 You also are required to submit a second essay that describes how you plan to engage in and contribute to the PRISE community.

Lab Citizenship.
Accepting an undergraduate into a research group and providing training for them is a very resource-intensive proposition for a lab, both in terms of the time commitment required from the lab mentors as well as the cost of laboratory supplies and reagents.
 It is incumbent upon students to recognize and respect this investment:.
Adhere to the scheduled time.
 Show that you appreciate the time that your mentors set aside from their own experiments to teach you by being meticulous about letting your mentor know well in advance when you are unable to come to the lab as scheduled.
Do not expect the mentor to be available to work with you if you show up in the lab at a time that is not on your regular schedule, because they may be in the middle of an experiment that cannot be interrupted for several hours.
.
Put forth a sincere effort when you are in the lab.
  This includes turning off your phone, ignoring text messages, avoiding surfing the web and chatting with your friends in the lab etc.
 You will derive more benefit from a good relationship with your lab both in terms of your achievements in research and future interactions with the PI if you demonstrate a sincere commitment to them.
 We have heard reports from some PIs who were unhappy with their undergraduates, because they did not appear to appreciate the time that their mentors spent working with them.
.
There will be “crunch” times, maybe even whole weeks, when you will be unable to work in the lab as many hours as you normally would because of midterms, finals, paper deadlines, illness or school vacations.
 This is fine, but remember to let your mentor know in advance when you anticipate absences.
 Disappearing from the lab for days without communicating with your mentor is not acceptable.
 Your lab mentor and PI are much more likely to be understanding about schedule changes if you keep the lines of communication open but they may be less charitable if you simply disappear for days or weeks at a time.
 From our conversations with students, we have learned that maintaining good communication and a strong relationship with the lab mentor and/or PI correlates well with an undergraduate’s satisfaction and success in the laboratory.
.
Perhaps the best way for you to demonstrate your appreciation of the lab’s commitment is to approach your project with genuine interest and intellectual curiosity.
 Regardless of how limited your time in the lab may be, it is crucial to convey a sincere sense of engagement with your project and the lab’s research goals.
 You want to avoid giving the impression that you are there merely to fulfill a degree requirement or as prerequisite for a post-graduate program.
.
TIME COMMITTMENT.
Term Time.
Freshman and Sophomore.
science courses include time consuming lab and section components.
 For this reason, it can be stressful for students to manage the time needed to fulfill these course requirements while simultaneously working in an outside lab.
 The general rule of thumb for students who are taking lab intensive courses is to plan on spending six to ten hours per week in their research labs.
 It is fairly common for students to commit to more hours per week than they can reasonably manage because they think that it will increase their chances of securing a lab position.
 However, it is probably better to slightly underestimate the time that you are able to spend in the lab and work longer hours when possible rather than overcommit and not be able to fulfill your obligation.
 Falling behind in your courses because you are spending too many hours in the lab is not a good trade-off.
 If you receive an offer from one of your top choice labs but the PI expresses unwillingness to compromise on a reasonable time commitment, it may be best to seek another position or to talk to one of the Life Sciences Advisors about how to respond to the situation.
 Most labs will be sensitive to the time issue especially if you explain the situation with your course schedule and have a clear plan for being in the lab during the January break, over the summer or a plan to take an independent research course for credit in junior year and/or write a senior thesis.
.
J.
uniors and seniors,.
who are doing research for credit through either an independent research or thesis course, normally spend a minimum of 15-20 hours per week in the lab (required hours may vary based on concentration, contact your.
Life Science Concentration Advisor.
).
.
Your course workload likely will vary during the semester and most labs will be sensitive to the “crunch” times for undergraduates.
 If you are overwhelmed with papers and midterms one week, talk to your mentor about making up the time later in the month.
 This is much better than ruining an experiment for which you have spent weeks preparing because you are unable to focus on work in the lab.
  Students should avoid making up lost time in the lab by working late at night or on weekends when other lab members are not present.
 Accidents can and do happen; therefore it is NEVER a good idea to work in the lab alone and this is especially true for students who have little or no lab experience.
 It is best to create a schedule that maximizes overlap time with your mentor; but if you need to work after normal lab hours, it is your responsibility to ensure that someone from the lab will be there with you.
.
We strongly advise students to consider seriously the time commitment that they can make to a lab and not agree to undertake more hours per week than they can reasonably manage during the term.
.
Summer.
Working in lab full time over the summer provides students with a great opportunity to consistently devote time to and become fully immersed in their research projects.
 For this reason, the Harvard summer undergraduate research programs require that students work in the lab a minimum of 40 hours a week for 10 weeks.
 Students who have outside jobs or other obligations during the summer and who are therefore unable to commit to working full time in the lab are not eligible for these fellowships.
 The exception to this standard is the Harvard College Research Program (HCRP), which may fund students for part-time lab work over the summer.
 Students must indicate on their HCRP applications the number of hours per week and the number of weeks they plan to work in the lab.

Research Ethics and Lab Safety.
Lab Safety Training:.
Harvard requires all new employees or trainees working in Harvard labs to pass a Laboratory Safety Training Course.
 On-line training is available through the EH&S.
Training Management System.
.
 Your lab manager or administrator will have the information about the course.
 In addition, many labs may mandate further safety training for specific techniques and procedures that they use.
  These trainings are particularly important for students who are just getting started in the lab and may not be familiar with the procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials or working with animals.
.
Research Integrity Training:.
Scientific research is governed at both the institutional and federal level.
 Harvard undergraduates are expected to become familiar with the ethical standards of their discipline and conduct their research activities with the highest level of integrity and commitment to excellence.
 As an undergraduate, you are encouraged to ask questions about proper practices and procedures, to be organized and accurate in all of your research activities, and to follow the directions of your faculty mentors and other research staff closely.
 In addition to the guidance that you receive from your faculty host, the Harvard Undergraduate Research and Fellowship Office offers online.
RCR training.
which will help determine whether student need additional.
Animal Research Training.
or.
Human Subject Research Training.
.
 If you work at the Harvard-affiliated hospital or Harvard-affiliated institute, they might have specific trainings.
 Thus, contact your PI for lab-specific requirements.

Harvard University Digital Accessibility Policy.
Harvard University Digital Accessibility Policy.
This Policy is established to promote equal access to information technology and digital content and to improve the user experience of IT and digital / online media for all users, including persons with disabilities.
.
Policy Statement.
Harvard University is committed to making University Information Technology and University Digital Content accessible.
.
For the purposes of this Policy, “accessible” means a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.
.
Policy Resources.

Digital Accessibility Policy Procedures.
Policy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
Read the Gazette article.
Digital Accessibility Standards.
Toward meeting the University’s commitment to accessibility, Harvard expects University Information Technology and University Digital Content to conform to applicable Digital Accessibility Standards to the fullest extent possible.
.
For the purposes of this Policy, the Digital Accessibility Standards (or “the Standards”) are The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.
1, Level AA Conformance (WCAG 2.
1 Level AA) for websites and web-based applications and services.
 Software and services that are not web-based should conform to WCAG 2.
1 Level AA to the extent such guidelines may usefully be applied to improve the accessibility of these resources.
.
In the case of digital hardware interfaces, the Standards also include the federal Section 508 standards described in Chapter 4 (“Hardware”) of Appendix C to 36 C.
F.
R.
 Part 1194, whether or not such instances of hardware are covered by the regulation.
.
The Path Forward.
New Instances of University IT.
Instances of University Information Technology newly purchased, licensed, or internally developed after June 1, 2023 are expected to conform to the Standards to the fullest extent possible at the point of rollout or implementation.
 Where such conformance with the Standards is not technically feasible or may require extraordinary measures due to the nature or purpose of the Information Technology, a request for exception may be submitted for review by an appropriate University, School, or Unit Authority.
.
New University Content.
Starting on June 1, 2023, Harvard users using University IT to post, distribute, or publish University Content should aim to make such content conform to the Standards, to the extent technically feasible and in accordance with the University Content framework specified in the Implementation Procedures.
 Where conformance with the Standards is not technically feasible, Harvard users should consider how to make University Content available in an alternative format accessible (as defined above) to persons with disabilities.
.
Existing University IT and Content.
As further outlined in the Implementation Procedures, the Accessibility Steering Committee will establish and recommend to Senior Leadership a prioritization plan for improving the accessibility of existing University Information Technology, including websites and web-based applications, and the existing University Content hosted, published, or communicated on those platforms.
 Priority will be given to University IT platforms that provide the most essential functions to, and are most broadly and regularly used by, Harvard faculty, staff, and students.
 In the case of public-facing websites, priority will be given to sites that are among the most highly trafficked and to those that contain core institutional information.
.
Procurement Considerations.
Harvard personnel purchasing or procuring University Information Technology are responsible for ensuring that suppliers seeking to develop or provide University IT are aware of this Policy and that contracts with such vendors hold them accountable to the Standards to the fullest extent possible.
 Harvard Strategic Procurement, the HUIT Vendor Management Office, and others charged with supporting IT procurement efforts should support these efforts when involved in IT purchases.
.
The Implementation Procedures published under this Policy will identify resources, strategies, and guidelines for securing the greatest possible level of conformance to the Standards from third-party vendors, and purchasers and providers of University IT are expected to adopt and practice them.
 The Policy expects that the University will apply such market power as it has to prioritize and promote digital accessibility.
 However, the Policy recognizes that the University is able to exert less control over some “off-the-shelf” Information Technology developed and marketed outside the University.
.
Definitions.
“University Information Technology” or “University IT” is Information Technology purchased, developed, deployed, or used for University Business and, in the case of web-based applications and websites, is hosted on a Harvard-owned or -controlled domain.
.
“Information Technology” includes software; server-based, personal computer, mobile device, and web-based applications and websites; website hosting and design services; development, hosting, maintenance, and archiving services; cloud-based applications and information processing or storage services; digital hardware interfaces; and digital database configurations and interfaces.
.
“University Content” is Digital Content created, posted, distributed or published for University Business.
.
“Digital Content” consists of any information or communication accessed or displayed in a digital format or medium, as text, image, audio, or video.
.
“University Business” includes activities carried out by Harvard faculty and staff in furtherance of Harvard University’s mission of teaching and research but does not include activities organized or conducted by students or student organizations.
.
“Senior Leadership” includes the University’s President, Provost, Executive Vice President, and Vice Presidents; the Deans of the several Schools, their Department Chairs, and the Directors of University and School Centers or their designees.
.
Responsibility.
The University expects that Senior Leadership will promote broad awareness of this Policy, assign responsibility to ensure the accessibility of University IT provided within their jurisdictions, and designate Digital Accessibility Liaisons.
 Improving digital accessibility requires the attention and commitment of the entire University community.
 Accordingly, all members of the Harvard community should be mindful of this Policy and aim to ensure that University Content they post to, publish on, or communicate through University IT is accessible.
.
Where possible, including on websites operated by the University, Harvard administrators should indicate commitment to accessibility by posting a link to this Policy.
.
Resources and Support.
The University is committed to providing resources and support to the Harvard community in order to effectuate this Policy.
.
Accessibility Steering Committee.
The Accessibility Steering Committee is convened by the President and/or Provost.
 In addition to preparing the prioritization plan described above (see “Existing University IT and Content”), the ASC is responsible for (1) providing periodic review and revision of this Policy and its Implementation Procedures, including making appropriate updates to the Policy’s Standards definition as industry standards and practices evolve, with recommendations going to the President and/or Provost; (2) working with Senior Leadership to promote general awareness of this Policy; (3) assessing and reporting to the President and/or Provost the University’s accessibility efforts as outlined in this Policy; and (4) establishing a process and designating appropriate authorities to review and decide on requests for Policy exceptions.
.
Digital Accessibility Services.
The Office of Digital Accessibility Services (“DAS”) within Harvard University Information Technology is responsible for supporting Senior Leadership across the University in creating and sustaining a culture of commitment at Harvard.
 In addition to devising Implementation Procedures for the ASC to review, DAS provides training, guidance, and information on accessibility standards and best practices and works with University IT purchasers and providers, and their technical partners, to advise or augment their efforts toward adopting the Standards.
 Guided by ASC priorities, DAS tracks and supports remediation efforts throughout Harvard.
.
Digital Accessibility Liaisons.
Digital Accessibility Liaisons (“DAL”) are appointed by Senior Leadership.
 DAL coordinate local accessibility efforts and report on progress to the ASC and DAS.
.
University Disability Resources.
University Disability Resources (UDR) within Central Administration provides leadership to University efforts to ensure an accessible, inclusive, and welcoming learning and working environment for persons with disabilities while complying with federal and state regulations.
 UDR serves as a University-wide resource on disability-related information, procedures, and services for the Harvard community, digital and otherwise.

Exceptions and Remediation.
As outlined in the Implementation Procedures, IT purchasers or providers requesting an exception to this Policy may be required to submit an accommodation plan detailing how the unit will make, as applicable, the services or information provided by the University IT in question available to persons with disabilities, by alternate accessible (as defined above) means.
 The additional cost and expense incurred to bring University IT into conformance will not be considered a valid basis for grant of an exception, except in extraordinary circumstances and as approved by the Accessibility Steering Committee (“ASC”).
 Further details on exceptions processes will be included in the Implementation Procedures document.
.
The ASC may require that some or all non-conforming portions of an instance of University Content (as provided in the University Content framework specified in the Implementing Procedures) or University IT be brought into conformance by designated staff or suppliers, and the expense of that work may be charged to the unit that is responsible for assuring the accessibility of that asset.
 If the ASC is unable to identify who is responsible for an instance of University Content that does not conform to the framework, then the ASC may ask that HUIT remove the non-conforming content from view until it can be brought into conformance.
.
Upon a specific request by an individual who is unable to access specific University Content due to non-conformance to the Standards, either the requested content must be updated to conform to the Standards or the requested content otherwise must be made available in an alternative format in a timely manner.
 The unit responsible for the creation and maintenance of University Content is responsible for making it accessible or providing the accessible alternative.
.
Disclaimer.
This Policy establishes internal guidelines and expectations for the purpose of promoting and advancing digital accessibility at Harvard University.
 Harvard reserves the right to modify the Policy unilaterally at any time.
 The Policy is not intended to create, nor does it create, any contractual or other legal obligation on Harvard’s part, or any contractual or other legal right for any member of the Harvard community or the general public.
.
Note:.
this updated Policy supersedes the previous Digital Accessibility Policy, which was made effective on April 30, 2019 and applied exclusively to “University Websites,” which was defined to include only certain public-facing websites within a Harvard-controlled domain.
 The updated Policy has a broader scope and applies to all websites within Harvard-controlled domains, as well as the other forms of Information Technology listed in the definition above.

.     "PROMPT: I AM A HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT WHO WANTS TO OPPORTUNITIES OR ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ESSAYS.     USE THE DATA ABOVE TO FIND SPECIFIC THINGS I CAN USE.     BE SURE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AND CONCISE ".     Interests: biology   
Generated Response:

As a high school student with an interest in Biology, exploring various activities and opportunities related to college admissions essays can be enriching and help showcase your passion for the subject. Here are some specific ideas you might consider engaging in or incorporating into your essay:

1. Volunteer or Intern at a Local Research Lab: Gain hands-on experience by assisting scientists in biology research labs, conducting experiments, and analyzing data. This will not only provide practical skills but also give you unique insights into the world of biological sciences that can be included in your essay.

2. Attend Biology Conferences or Webinars: Expand your knowledge by attending conferences or webinars on topics related to biology, such as genetics, evolutionary biology, or ecology. Not only will you learn about cutting-edge research but also gain ideas for your essay by discussing the latest findings in these fields.

3. Participate in Biological Field Work: Engage with nature and observe wildlife through field work opportunities like birding expeditions, insect collections, or plant identification projects. These experiences will not only help you connect with nature but also provide interesting anecdotes to share in your essay about the beauty of biology.

4. Attend a Summer Biology Camp: Enroll in summer camps focused on biology, where you can take classes, conduct experiments, and meet like-minded individuals interested in the field. These experiences will allow you to develop new perspectives on biological concepts while potentially adding personal narratives to your essay.

5. Write for a Science Blog or Journal: Share your love for Biology by contributing articles, news summaries, or opinion pieces about current topics in biology to a science blog or journal. This not only shows your passion and dedication but also gives you an opportunity to reflect on the significance of biology in our lives, which can be used as inspiration for your essay.

6. Start a Personal Biology Project: Develop your own independent research project related to biology, such as investigating local plant adaptations or studying biodiversity. By creating your own project and documenting your process, you'll demonstrate both initiative and your passion for the subject while contributing new knowledge to the field of study.

7. Join a Biology Club: Connect with other students who share your enthusiasm for Biology by joining a school or community club where you can discuss topics in biology, participate in related activities, and learn from others' experiences. This will give you a chance to explore different aspects of the field while developing connections with like-minded peers.

8. Learn About Ethics in Science: Examine ethical issues surrounding biological research, such as the use of animals for experimentation or genetically modified organisms. Reflecting on these moral dilemmas will not only contribute to your personal growth but also provide food for thought in writing about biology and its impact on society.

In summary, embracing various activities related to biology, such as participating in research labs, attending conferences or webinars, exploring field work opportunities, engaging with summer camps, contributing to science blogs, developing personal projects, joining a club, or reflecting on ethical aspects of biological research can all contribute towards enriching your knowledge and providing fodder for college admissions essays.
