David Rockefeller International Experience Grant.
The David Rockefeller International Experience Grants were established in 2009 by David Rockefeller SB ’36, LLD ’69 to give students the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of the world beyond the U.
S.
 or their home country, and to learn about other countries and peoples by spending time immersed in another culture.
 The purpose of the grant is to afford all students the opportunity to take part in a significant international experience, regardless of financial constraints.
.
A significant international experience may consist of:.
summer study abroad programs.
internships and service projects.
research assistantships (under the direction of a principle investigator).
experiential learning projects.

The Senses.
Our senses help us experience the world around us.
 Harvard researchers are working to understand, improve, and replicate these sensory organs.
.
The ins and outs.
The act of sensing starts with stimulus from the world, which triggers a physiological response, which is combined with previous experiences, which results in an internal representation, which is our brain’s best guess at what’s going on around us.

Hearing, like the sense of touch, involves detecting the movement of molecules in the world outside ourselves.
 Those outside vibrations become internal signals, which can combine into conversations or orchestrations.

A gene-therapy breakthrough has given children born deaf the ability to hear.
The discovery may yield future treatments for the 30 million kids with genetic hearing loss.

Researchers have discovered the protein that may be responsible for hearing and balance.
A 2018 study concludes that TMC1 is the critical molecular sensor that converts sound and motion into electrical signals the brain can understand.

.     "PROMPT: I AM A HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT WHO WANTS TO OPPORTUNITIES OR ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ESSAYS.     USE THE DATA ABOVE TO FIND SPECIFIC THINGS I CAN USE.     BE SURE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AND CONCISE ".     Interests: biology
Generated Response:

As a high school student focused on college admissions essays, it's important to consider various angles and explore different perspectives while discussing your interests in the field of biology. Drawing inspiration from Harvard research and discoveries within the life sciences can help you demonstrate a genuine understanding of this topic and its relevance in higher education.

When it comes to highlighting your interest in specific aspects of biology, consider research on human senses as an example. Harvard scientists have made significant progress in studying our sensory perceptions, from touch sensitivity to genetic hearing loss treatments. Discuss how these findings can be applied to understanding and improving the quality of life for those living with these conditions.

Another fascinating area is Harvard's work on animal senses. Understanding how different species detect and respond to their environments (e.g., octopus touch sensors or narwhal tusk nerves) can reveal intriguing biological adaptations. These discoveries might even inspire new technologies or solutions for sensory problems in humans.

Furthermore, you may explore the science of taste, as Harvard researchers have studied how our brains combine different senses to create flavors. This could lead to a discussion on supertasters and non-tasters or the importance of expanding flavor descriptors beyond traditional terms.

In summary, by exploring the fascinating world of biology through Harvard's groundbreaking research and discoveries in sensory sciences, you can demonstrate your passion for the field and highlight its potential impact on both human health and technological advancements. Remember to keep your ideas clear, concise, and relevant to your interest in college admissions essays.
