What are the requirements to use the Stretch Internet portal?.
If you're on a desktop or laptop computer, we suggest using the latest
                                            version of.
Chrome.
or.
Firefox.
.
 If you're using
                                            an alternate browser, please ensure you're using the most updated
                                            version of that browser.
 To access live
                                            or on-demand video, you will need a download speed of at least 1.

0 Mbps (3,000
                                            Kbps) for high definition broadcasts.
 You can measure your download
                                            speed atwww.

net.
 Our broadcasts are also compatible on any
                                            Apple mobile devices running iOS 7 or later and on Android devices
                                            running OS 4.

4 or later.
 If you're wishing to view the broadcasts on
                                            your TV, we suggest using AppleTV to wirelessly stream content from a
                                            Mac or Apple mobile device â€“ or connecting an HDMI cable from your
                                            computer or device to your TV.
 While some Smart TVs can also be used to
                                            access our streams, we cannot guarantee compatibility.
.
Why is the portal not loading correctly or missing information?.
If you're having issues loading the portal or accessing content on a
                                            computer, please make sure you're using the latest versions of.
Chrome.
or.
Firefox.
.
 We also suggest that you clear your browser's.
cache.
, quit your
                                            web browser, and try to relaunch the portal.
.
Are there multiple viewing options in the portal?.
While viewing a broadcast on a tablet or computer, you will see either 2
                                            or 3 icons at the right of the event description bar near the top of the
                                            portal.
 The first icon provides a "full view" option with the video
                                            presentation maximizing the portal.
 The second icon offers a split view
                                            and is helpful if the client is utilizing any other features, such as
                                            Twitter feeds or live stats updates.
 If you're watching a live sporting
                                            event and the client has live stats available, the third icon offers a
                                            "stats heavy" window with rich statistical information and a minimized
                                            video or audio player.
 Additionally, you can watch up to four events
                                            simultaneously in the portal by clicking on any of the view icons at the
                                            bottom of the video player, and selecting another available event.
.
Do I need to sign in or register to access an event?.
If you're attempting to watch a live or on-demand event that is free,
                                            you generally will not be required to create an account or sign in.
 For
                                            live events, simply click on the "Watch" or "Listen" icon and you'll be
                                            redirected immediately to the portal page for the event.
 If the portal
                                            is set up on a pay-per-view or pay-per-listen basis, you will be
                                            required to register or sign-in, and you'll be guided through the steps
                                            after clicking on the icon for any event.
.
Why am I experiencing low-quality audio or video?.
If you're experiencing video or audio playback that skips, freezes or
                                            buffers, please ensure you have sufficient bandwidth and computer
                                            resources available.
 Buffering can also occur if there are connection
                                            issues on-site.
 If you're not experiencing video or audio playback
                                            issues, but encountering other issues, such as pixellated video or
                                            distorted audio, there are very likely issues at the originating site.

                                            We work proactively with our partners to address these issues and
                                            are generally able to resolve them in a timely manner, but certain
                                            conditions are outside our control.
 Please click the "Submit Support
                                            Request" link inside the "Help" tab if you need assistance addressing
                                            issues.
.
Why do I not see any events listed on my iPad or iPhone?.
Most likely, you have Safari set to browse in "Private Mode.
" Please
                                            turn "Private Mode" off and try to re-load the page.
.
Are the live broadcasts available for archived viewing?.
Archived broadcasts will be available in the "On Demand" tab of the
                                        portal.
 Keep in mind that our staff manually edits and prepares the
                                        archives for most audio-only events before they are posted to the
                                        portal, so please allow up to 72 hours or more for those to become
                                        available.
 Video archives are generally available almost immediately
                                        following the event.
 Keep in mind that many clients choose not to
                                        archive some or all of their events, or choose to password-protect
                                        their archives.
 If you are asked for a password prompt, please contact
                                        the client directly if you're like to request access.
.
Who do I contact with a complaint about the broadcast production?.
If you don't have any issues with the audio or video playback, but have
                                            a complaint about an element of the production, you can use the "Submit
                                            Support Request" link inside the "Help" tab.
 While Stretch Internet does
                                            NOT produce the broadcasts and makes no warranties about the content of
                                            any broadcast, we can relay your comments or concerns to the school
                                            producing the event.
 Examples of production-related complaints include
                                            poor camera operation, mispronunciations, factual inaccuracies, etc.
.
Why are live stats not available for every game?.
Our live stats modules utilize XML code generated by the software used
                                            by the majority of colleges and universities.
 However, the only sports
                                            that include live stats output are soccer, field hockey, volleyball,
                                            basketball, ice hockey, baseball, softball and lacrosse.
 Additionally,
                                            some schools choose not to utilize our live stats service, while others
                                            only provide live stats for home games, and that can also be contingent
                                            on the availability of a high-speed Internet connection.
.
Why are the live stats frozen or not synced up with the audio or video?.
Streaming traffic uses a different protocol and transfer mechanism than
                                            live stats, so it's virtually impossible to guarantee a perfect sync
                                            between the two.
 Also keep in mind that the stats might not be entered
                                            immediately on site, which can result in delays in the live stats.
 If
                                            the on-site stats computer is experiencing technical difficulties, the
                                            live stats will not update.
 We contact our schools when the stats have
                                            not been updated for 5 or more minutes, but you're also welcome to
                                            contact us using the support link if you think there might be an issue.
.

.
What is your refund policy?.
If you are a paying subscriber and are unsatisfied with the quality of the product
                                            or services we provided, we will refund single-event passport fees for live or
                                            on-demand audio or video subscriptions in full if, a) there are confirmed, authenticated
                                            issues originating solely with the Stretch Internet services, including network downtime
                                            and/or latency, or, b) the broadcasting partner experiences technical difficulties which
                                            result in transmission quality deemed as low or unacceptable by the Stretch Internet support
                                            staff, and/or c) the broadcast is canceled or postponed before the completion of the event.

                                            If you have purchased a season or all-access pass that includes the event in question, a
                                            pro-rated refund will be issued upon request.
 You should always ensure your systems are
                                            compatible with the minimum requirements outlined in the Stretch Internet FAQ section on the
                                            portal.
 If you experience difficulties during a live event, you should contact us immediately
                                            so as to allow our support staff a chance to remedy any issues in a timely fashion.
