Deep Springs College – Wikipedia.Deep Springs College.aus Wikipedia, der freien Enzyklopädie.Zur Navigation springen.Zur Suche springen.Blick von der Ranch zum Deep Springs Valley.Deep Springs College.ist ein zweijähriges.Liberal-Arts-College.für Männer auf einer.Ranch.im.Inyo County.in der.Mojave-Wüste.Kaliforniens.. Die Philosophie des Colleges beruht auf Studium, physischer Arbeit und Selbstbestimmung. Deep Springs hat 26 Studenten und wurde 1917 von.Lucien Lucius Nunn.(1853–1925) gegründet..Inhaltsverzeichnis.1.Philosophie.2.Studenten.3.Arbeit auf der Ranch.4.Selbstbestimmung.5.Bekannte Absolventen.6.Literatur.7.Weblinks.Philosophie.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Die Studenten von Deep Springs sollen in intensiven Kontakt mit der Natur, Arbeit und Ideen gebracht werden. Es werden keine Studiengebühren erhoben, aber Anstrengung, Selbstbestimmung und Gemeinschaftsdienste werden von jedem Studenten erwartet. Lernen soll die Lösung praktischer und sozialer Probleme ermöglichen und zielt auf intellektuelles Verständnis und.humanes.Handeln ab..Studenten.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Bewerber werden von Lehrern und Studenten gemeinsam evaluiert und potentielle Kandidaten zu individuellen, mehrtägigen Interviews eingeladen. Studenten des College haben typischerweise weit über 700 Punkte im verbalen Teil des.SAT.und um 700 im mathematischen Teil erreicht. Zwischen 6 % und 15 % der Bewerber werden angenommen, damit gehört Deep Springs zu den selektivsten Colleges der Vereinigten Staaten..Deep Springs ist ein.zweijähriges College.. Nur eine sehr kleine Minderheit (drei bis vier pro Jahrzehnt) der Studenten erwirbt nach den zwei Jahren einen Abschluss (.Associate Degree.), da fast alle Absolventen zu diesem Zeitpunkt an ein anderes College wechseln, um ihren.Bachelor.dort nach weiteren zwei Jahren abzuschließen. Viele besuchen nach Deep Springs angesehene Universitäten wie.Harvard University.,.University of Chicago.,.Yale University.oder.Brown University...Arbeit auf der Ranch.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Studenten und Mitarbeiter des College beim Viehtrieb.Deep Springs ist kein landwirtschaftliches College. Die Studenten sind jedoch stark in die Arbeit auf der Ranch eingebunden. Alle sieben Wochen werden den Studenten Arbeitspositionen zugeordnet, die vom Geschirrspülen über Beherbergung bis zur Geburtshilfe bei Rindern reichen. Die Studenten arbeiten mindestens 20 Stunden pro Woche. Jeder Student kann eine Liste seiner bevorzugten Positionen einreichen, über deren Vergabe wiederum ein anderer Student entscheidet..Die Ranch hat einen ökologisch bewirtschafteten Garten, der einen.Obstgarten., ein.Gewächshaus.,.Komposthaufen., einen Hühnerstall und Gemüsebeete umfasst..Die Rinderherde ist etwa 300 Tiere stark. Im Sommer grasen die Tiere in den.White Mountains.und werden von studentischen.Cowboys.betreut..Auf der Farm wird auf knapp 62.Hektar.Luzerne.angebaut. Die Ernte wird fast vollständig an die Rinderherde verfüttert. Der Anbau erfolgt ohne.Pflanzenschutzmittel.. Die Bewässerung stammt aus dem Wyman Creek und wird ergänzt durch.Brunnen...Selbstbestimmung.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Die Selbstbestimmung soll den Studenten die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen.demokratischer Prozesse.nahebringen. Es gibt jedoch einige Grundregeln. Dazu gehören der Verzicht auf.Alkohol.und andere.Drogen.und das Nichtverlassen des Tals während des Schuljahres. Es gibt mehrere Komitees, die sich aus Studenten und Lehrern zusammensetzen. Diese sind etwa für Bewerbungen, den Studienaufbau, die Evaluierung von Studenten und die Kommunikation mit der Außenwelt zuständig. Positionen wie Schatzmeister, Feuerwehrmeister oder Archivar werden durch Abstimmung besetzt. Jeden Freitagabend treffen sich alle Studenten und Lehrer zu mehrstündigen Diskussionen..Bekannte Absolventen.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Benjamin Kunkel., Schriftsteller.William A.

A key clause of the Trust reads in part:.It shall be the duty of said Trustees to accord the Student Body the full right, power and authority of democratic self-governance in accordance with its traditions and the ideals and policies of Deep Springs set forth in the correspondence and documents of the Grantor….It’s common to hear that “the students run the college.” While this isn’t entirely true, students are responsible for many functions that in a regular college setting are the sole purvey of administrators; doing so meets a key part of the educational goals of Deep Springs. The Student Body convenes once a week to deliberate and take action on any issues concerning their participation in community life, labor on the ranch, academic plans, disciplinary matters, election of office holders, and more..The Student Body.—or.SB.—has its own set of by-laws distinct from the college and determines its own rules. There are four primary standing committees, all of which are chaired by students (though one or two staff members sit on each committee, students carry the majority of votes). At the beginning of each year, students vote to determine who will serve on which committee and the groups meet weekly throughout the subsequent academic year..The Applications Committee.reviews all student applications for admission and selects each year’s new incoming class..The Curriculum Committee.reviews all applications from prospective professors, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty re-hire..The Review and Reinvitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year to determine whether students will be re-invited for a second year. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..In addition to the standing committees, ad-hoc groups regularly gather to consider new staff hiring, safety issues around campus, special event planning and requests from potential visitors and media to the valley. These activities require diligent practice in the exercise of good judgment with both their peers and the institution. Since Deep Springs is a two-year program, students may often not even remain on campus to experience the results of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they are obligated to make the best choices for students who follow..Besides these administrative functions, students also require themselves to engage in regular discussions of philosophical questions concerning tenets of the Deep Springs education. In this way, they continually reinvigorate the meaning and impact of governance “by, of and for the students.”.Ground Rules.The student body historically maintains two ground rules for its members during academic session. The Deep Springs Student Handbook explains:.The Ground Rules shall apply at all times that a student is within Deep Springs Valley or adjacent area during the regular academic terms.  These Ground Rules shall also apply at all times that a student is outside the Valley on official trustee business, Student Body trips, or field trips for an academic course..1.   The use of alcohol and other drugs, for other than medicinal purposes, is prohibited..2.  No student shall leave Deep Springs during the regular academic term except on official trust business, Student Body trips, field trips for an academic course, or in the case of medical emergency. No student shall, without the prior permission of the SB, invite a guest out to Deep Springs..DEEP SPRINGS HANDBOOK, APPENDIX I, AS AMENDED IN 1997.Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Deep Springs is probably most like Caltech in that it is small, very highly selective, generous with financial aid and students bond over shared experiences which the outside world doesn't understand. That said, Deep Springs is completely unlike any of those institutions..Deep Springs is small: its 25 students wouldn't fill one residence hall (hovse) at Caltech..Deep Springs is isolated: the college occupies a desert valley in eastern California between Los Angeles and Reno, many miles from the nearest town, Big Pine, California and the (student-enforced) Isolation Policy restricts outside interactions..Deep Springs Students have an unusual amount of control over the college: an elected student Trustee is a full voting member of the small board of trustees. The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation. I am the only member of my class with an occupation even remotely related to agriculture (I am a retired veterinarian): others are MDs, lawyers, college professors, artists and writers..You can see the Milky Way on any moonless night; not true of any of the other colleges I have been to..8K views.·.View upvotes.·.1 of 5 answers.View.4.other answers to this question.About the Author.Paul Michelsen.Retired Large Animal Veterinarian.Worked at.Retirement.Studied at.Deep Springs College.Lives in.Potter Valley, CA.486.6K content views.3.3K this month.Published Writer.Slate.Active in 1 Space.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

The resolution adopted at the time reads in part, “The Trustees have carefully considered the purpose of Deep Springs, how best to achieve the purpose, and changes in society since the college was founded. Therefore, the Trustees determine that it is appropriate to plan and implement a transition to a coeducational student body, subject to ongoing board review.”.In February of 2012, the Board petitioned the Inyo County Court to reinterpret or change the College’s Deed of Trust to allow students to be admitted without regard for gender. This petition was opposed in court by the two Trustees who dissented from the coeducation vote. While the legal process played out over the next five and a half years, the court barred Deep Springs from taking action to admit female students..Days before the College’s 100th Anniversary Reunion was set to take place on campus at the end of June 2017, the Board was allowed to proceed with coeducation when the California Supreme Court rejected the final appeal of those opposed to coeducation..The first coeducational class at Deep Springs College was recruited and applied in 2017, and its members arrived on campus in July of 2018. As the College enters its second century as an experiment in higher education, the Board and community are proud to be able to review applications from all promising young people..Below is a timeline of the legal process.

The College is the only habitation in the Valley, which is approximately the size of Manhattan. The nearest large town, Bishop, California, is 40 miles away. The physical isolation and natural beauty of our location are integral parts of the educational program. Students regularly make trips to the Sierra Nevada, Death Valley National Park, the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, and many other nearby wildernesses. In the summer, we experience hot, dry desert temperatures above 100℉ (38℃) and in the winter,  extreme cold, at times below 20℉ (-6℃)..Campus facilities include a laboratory, gym, and music room. Some labor positions require use of the wood and metal shops on campus. Our library includes the contents of L.L. Nunn’s personal library as a portion of its nearly 30,000 volumes..Cattle from the College’s ranch graze throughout the valley on private and leased lands. About 7 miles south of campus is Deep Springs Lake. The large, seasonal salt lake is notable for its active Dolomite formation. The freshwater springs that fill it are home to the Valley’s own endemic species, the Deep Spring Toad..Deep Springs Valley has been inhabited for thousands of years. It was home to Paiute people until the early 20th century. Petroglyphs can be seen at sites around the valley. Signs of Basque sheepherding operations can also be seen. The original farm built at Deep Springs supplied food to miners in the White Mountains. L.L. Nunn bought the property in 1917, and the first classes of students assisted in the construction of many campus buildings..The dormitory, Boarding House (our dining hall), Main Building (which houses offices, classrooms, and library) and faculty housing are clustered around the College’s Main Circle. Slightly farther afield, students can be found on the “Lower Ranch,” home to the garden, corrals, horse barn, and additional housing..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

One was drafted after he finished residency in psychiatry and went in as a Major. He was assigned to XVIIIth Airborne Coros and went on jump status. He went to Viet Nam twice on psychiatric studies. The other passed California Bar, got married, and got drafted in the same week. He was offered direct commission in Judge Advocate Corps but this was a five year active duty commitment. He chose to remain enlisted and was trained as a courtroom clerk and then became a Company Clerk on Okinawa. Two went into Air Force Reserve. One other was killed in Israel while serving as Economics Officer at US Embassy. So six out of seven or six of my class served. It should be noted that five or six of class were varsity athletes in high school: crew, baseball, football, track, and wrestling.

These unique undergraduates basically run their own school, work the ranch where it is located, and complete a rigorous curriculum, an itinerary that “creates an environment of intense growth and responsibility.” Class work occurs in a seminar format in which “teachers participate similarly to students.” Classes “aren’t so much a transfer of information from professor to student as they are a time for the entire class to push the boundaries of collective thought as far as possible.” Composition and public speaking are the only required courses; all others are chosen by the student body and taught by a faculty of three long-term professors (one each in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences) and one to three visiting scholars or artists. The system relies on a commitment to self-determination, which means “how successful Deep Springs is as an institution depends upon the manner in which its students are engaging with its project.” While the size of the school inevitably means that “lab and library facilities are not what they might be,” students tell us that the overall Deep Springs experience compensates for any shortcomings. A student explains: “Mistakes and flaws are seen as pedagogy in action. See a broken fence or heater? Fix it, or learn to fix it. The mechanical skills we pick up during the process of taking responsibility for our livelihood are surely valuable, but the self-confidence and that emerges from learning to do things one never could have thought possible is the essence of a Deep Springer’s education.”.Student Body.“It is impossible to characterize a ‘typical’ student,” students understandably warn, but they add that “we all are hardworking and are committed to a life of service.” Undergrads are also predictably “outdoorsy,” “interested in the arts,” “motivated, and responsible,” as “it takes a unique type of person to even consider Deep Springs, much less succeed and thrive in such an environment.” As one student puts it, “The typical student at Deep Springs is committed to the life of the intellect and committed to finding education in our labor program. Most of the students here believe that a life of service, informed by discourse and labor, is a necessary notion to understand in today’s world.”.Campus Life.At Deep Springs, where “the desert sun rises slowly,” everyday student life is totally unlike other colleges because “no one drinks, everyone helps run the ranch in some way, and no one can be totally self-absorbed (unless he’s out hiking in the desert).” Instead, students immerse themselves in the Deep Springs way. As one student explains, “Life is very intellectual but also in constant relationship to the natural beauty of the desert and the operation of the College’s farm and ranch.” Conversations tend to revolve around “what work needs to be done, what decisions need to be made, [and] which classes are most interesting,” or, as one student puts it, “Sunsets. Hegel. Welding. Jane Austen.” Fun at Deep Springs, where days are “marked by an extreme busyness,” is “self-generated”: “‘Fun’ is hard to come by, and one has to learn how to enjoy people, work, and engagement.” Students do occasionally take a break, however: “Fun just means something a little different...Half-naked dances to Miley Cyrus, fully naked soccer, or fully clothed conversations on anything from Kierkegaard to Kanye West ensure that there really isn’t a dull moment in the Valley.” Also, occasionally “there are ‘boojies’,” a kind of hectic dance party in the Rumpus Room of the dorm, “ or students will “go to the dunes a valley over for a bit of late-night naked surfing down the sand.” Undergrads concede that Deep Springs “life can be intense”: There is “a whirlwind of activity from labor to class to meals to labor again to meetings to a few precious hours of sleep. But where many students would find such a lifestyle stressful and unsustainable, we find it meaningful and valuable” and that keeps undergrads energized and motivated.”.Read More.Contact & Visit.See More.See Less.Campus Visits Contact.Contact.Tim Olsen.Chair, Applications Committee.Address.Applications Committee.HC 72    Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Phone.7608722000.Email.apcom@deepsprings.edu.Experience College Life.Most Popular Places On Campus.Boarding House.Dairy Barn.Horse Stables.The Upper Reservoir.The Druid.Deep Springs does not offer tours or visits to the general public or to prospective applicants.

The Labor Pillar is an integral part of a Deep Springs education, and all students must work twenty hours a week in an assigned role, building a sense of dedication to community and a strong work ethic that translates to the real world. As students learning to be citizens of the world, many eventually go on to “a life of service” following the completion of a degree. Since Deep Springs is a two-year school, most everyone transfers to a more typical four-year institution, and even though some take a year or two to travel or volunteer after their time at Deep Springs, ultimately, more than 95 percent of students complete a bachelor’s degree and more than half go on to receive graduate and terminal degrees.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious.

They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal.

All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill.

They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back.

Here is my personal take on it:.Elite schools are those whose programs of study rank very highly in the press, have high demand, and end up rejecting many more times the number of applications they receive than they admit..These are typically the most expensive privately owned schools and are the hardest to get into. They have the biggest names: Harvard. Yale. Stanford. MIT. The rich and famous go to school there. Children of US Presidents go there. Everyone wants to go there..All colleges aren’t considered “elite” because not every school is as selective as the aforementioned big names. The US is a democracy and a higher education has long been touted as a necessity to have in our developed, information-centric economy..Therefore, the US has many state-sponsored public universities who instead of setting high entry barriers, make it their mission to give the opportunity to earn a college degree to any well-performing high school graduate from their state’s schools that they have space for and can admit. These schools are the “state flagship” schools, and their programs of study are no less rigorous or legitimate than the “elites,” but they offer their state’s residents as excellent a higher education at a fraction of the cost of an “elite” school..It’s a bit like doing one’s grocery shopping at Whole Foods (elite) or Aldi/Costco, where one gets nearly the same quality but pays much more or less for the same stuff, depending on which store they shop at. Consider “financial aid” to be the “store coupons” in the grocery stores. You may not have as much financial aid at a state flagship school, and it may involve loans more than gift aid, but at least you’ll be offered a seat at the table and it will be priced reasonably, whereas the elites will run you through a meat grinder to decide whether or not to let you in, but if you’re admitted after all that and your family cannot afford the exorbitant tuition cost that can run from 5 to 10 times what a state resident may pay at a flagship, they take care of it for you 100% through gift aid..Related questions.What is the meaning of an elite college?.Which Ivy League schools are considered the "elite" of the elite, and why?.Which colleges are considered elite but not Ivy Leagues?.What colleges are considered "elite"?.What is the difference between a "top college" and an "elite college"?.Is it true that what is taught in the classes at elite universities (e.g. Harvard) is actually not very different from that of non-elite universities? I have heard that what sets elite universities apart is the networking opportunities they offer..What are some reasons why Ivy League schools are not considered elite?.What are some elite colleges/universities that are not part of the "Ivy League" but are still highly prestigious and selective?.What is wrong with elite universities?.What is the difference between "top" and "elite" universities/colleges in America?.Is being labeled as "elite" by colleges significant?.How relatively easy is it to transfer from a top UK University (Oxford/Cambridge) to a top US Univ (Stanford/Harvard)?.Is there a difference between getting into an elite school and an elite program at a non-elite school?.Why are degrees from elite colleges not relevant anymore?.All the elite colleges were founded hundreds of years ago, but so were many colleges not necessarily considered elite. So why are only those select few colleges "elite" and not the rest?

Everyone plays an integral role in keeping our ranch, farm, garden and kitchen going. The exact list of positions varies with the season, the needs of the College, and the plans of the LC. Common positions include: Cook, Baker, BH (cleaning the dishes), Butcher, Cowboy, Dairy (milking cows), Farm (moving irrigation lines), Garden, General Labor Crew, Mechanic’s Assistant, and Orderly. Most positions last for a term—2 months—though some require a greater time commitment..Participation in labor is not done in exchange for a Deep Springs education. Rather, the labor pillar is an integral part of that education. The labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and integrity/responsibility. Working with live animals that depend upon routine care gives you an opportunity to engage in work that has high stakes. Serving in a kitchen for such a small community, where everybody knows each other intimately, means that everybody knows who is responsible when a meal is out late..Farm & Ranch.Deep Springs operates a USDA Certified Organic cattle ranch and 150-acre hay farm. The college sells both hay and beef cattle for a modest income, but the ranch and farm are maintained primarily for educational purposes..The ranch keeps about 200 head of beef cattle which graze throughout the valley and in the White Mountains. With supervision from the ranch manager, students perform much of the necessary ranch work, from herding cattle to shoeing horses to delivering calves. More than a dozen horses are kept for ranch work and recreation. Students receive training in basic horsemanship, and many take advantage of the opportunity to go on frequent horseback rides..The hay farm is a large part of the student labor program, owing to the work required to irrigate, harvest, and periodically replant the fields. The farm manager trains students to operate and repair irrigation equipment as well as drive the tractors and harvesting machinery. The college has a fleet of trucks, tractors, and farm implements which are maintained on-site by staff and students..In addition to the hay and cattle operations, pigs, broiler chickens, and laying hens are raised for consumption at the college. A dairy barn with several cows provides the community with milk. Produce is grown in our one-acre vegetable garden and orchard, and greenhouses extend the growing season into the winter. Students often have the opportunity to tackle special short-term agricultural projects based on their own interests..Staff.In addition to the faculty, the Deep Springs is home to a dynamic team of staff and their families who work to make this place run smoothly and pedagogically. The staff is housed either on the main ranch or on a tract of land less than a mile north of the college. They do not, however, constitute a distinct group of employees of the college. The staff is most commonly referred to in combination with the faculty and vice versa as “staffulty.” A Deep Springer is likely to find all members of the community at meals, public speaking, and other community events..One of the key aspects of the labor pillar is the relationship students build with staff members. Staff members act as mentors and managers, often teaching students how to do the labor in question while also ensuring the continued functioning of the labor operation they supervise..Bios.Tim Gipson.Farm & Ranch Manager. Tim is responsible for the College’s cattle and horse herds, as well as the farm, and the thousands upon thousands of acres of public land on which the ranch operates. His other duties include student Horsemanship Instructor and mentor of the ranch cowboys. He grew up in Ohio working on farms and moved out west shortly after high school. He has worked on some of the largest ranches in the country and he and his wife, Kathryn, ran their own cattle herd in Wyoming for several years. He and Kathryn have been married for 25 years and they have 3 grown boys and one grandson..Katie Ippolito.Office Manager. Katie came to Deep Springs from the East Coast, having recently completed a Master’s degree in Higher Education Administration at the University of Pennsylvania. Her background is in neuroscience, a subject she pursued during her undergraduate years at Bowdoin College. As much as she loved being in the lab, Katie was even more excited to make information accessible and explore how engaged learning could change people’s lives and their communities for the better. While looking for a job that would allow her to connect with students and envision high-impact paths through higher education, Katie remembered Deep Springs—a college that had stood out to her since high school for its singular approach to thoughtful leadership and service. You can now find her in the Main Building (or grabbing tea from the BH) as she supports ongoing work to make the College run sustainably and inventively for years to come..Sarah Knight.Boarding House Manager. Sarah Knight has been in the hospitality and restaurant world for almost 15 years, gaining experience in a range of settings from luxury hotels to high-end restaurants. After culinary school and working in the industry for some time, Sarah wanted to see where her food came from. She started a livestock apprenticeship in 2020 where she learned how to raise animals in a regenerative manner. At this time, she also started her journey into animal slaughter and butchery.  Sarah expanded her pursuit of food systems education through UCLA online courses on Environment and Sustainability, and continues to write, read, and learn about the way food reaches our tables..John Martindale.Facilities and Grounds Manager. I have lived in Bishop, California most of my life and Deep Springs College is what I consider to be one of the most important institutions that we have in Inyo county..While raising two wonderful children I have worked to teach them the principles that are at the heart of the college: work hard, have a solid moral compass, and spend time serving others who are less fortunate than you..I often have sought out the “voice of the desert” when times were tough, and I once again find that peace and tranquility here on the campus. My years in contracting have served me well as this is a job site with such a large variety of tasks that I should never fear boredom..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Lazy afternoons on the quad, parties, homecoming games and, too often, crippling student debt. Tonight, we'll take you to a school that has none of those. In terms of class size, it's one of the smallest colleges in the country. In terms of landmass, one of the largest. For two years, around 26 of the world's brightest come to California to live in seclusion, govern their own affairs and submit to rigorous coursework and hard labor on a working ranch. An experiment in education designed to forge the leaders of tomorrow, dreamt up by an eccentric industrialist a century ago. Think your school was rigorous? Think your school had its quirks? Join us on a visit to Deep Springs..In the shadow of eastern California's High Sierra, hemmed by twisting mountain passes, Deep Springs College is an oasis of green set amid a no man's land of sage-brush and endless sky..Deep Springs College's campus.Here, students from around the world labor in the classroom and on the grounds, where there is no football field, but there is an alfalfa field. And the syllabus includes philosophy, calculus and pre-dawn cow milking. Student-farmers grow the produce that student-cooks prepare..There are student mail carriers, student mechanics....And student ranchers who drive some 300 head of cattle across a valley almost twice the size of manhattan..Jon Wertheim: had you ever ridden a horse before you came here?.Ziani Paiz: Ah like a pony ride once or twice. [laugh].When we visited, Ziani Paiz was one of two students assigned to work as a Deep Springs cowboy..Jon Wertheim: You could have gone to a school with-- with concerts and parties, and football games. Do you ever feel like you're missing out?.Ziani Paiz: No. [laugh] Not at all. I feel like never again in my life am I gonna have an opportunity to live in a place like this..60 Minutes visits Deep Springs College.Like everybody here, Ziani was an academic all-star in high school. People back home in east LA. Found her choice of college mystifying..Jon Wertheim: What'd your friends say when you told them where you were going to school?.Ziani Paiz: Oh, they thought I was so stupid..Jon Wertheim: What do they think you should have done?.Ziani Paiz: Taken a four-year scholarship to a real school..Jon Wertheim: Was that-- was that an option?.Ziani Paiz: Yeah..Jon Wertheim: C-- can I ask what school?.Ziani Paiz: Berkeley. [laugh].Jon Wertheim: you had a four-year scholarship lined up to Berkeley..Ziani Paiz: Yeah..Jon Wertheim: You said, "Nah. I'm-- I'm gonna come to the desert and-- be--be a cowhand".Ziani Paiz: Yeah..Jon Wertheim: What-- what is this feeding in you? What-- what are you getting out of this?.Ziani Paiz: At base level, you know, fun. It's a lot of fun to, like, run on a horse and chase a cow, you know. But I think you-- you also do genuinely learn life skills from that. I think you-- you can't quit when the work gets hard you know..Ziani Paiz.Deep Springs was built on a kind of formula: take a handful of the best and brightest, put them in the middle of nowhere. Add rigorous academics, labor, and autonomy and you'll get future leaders..It's not for everyone. A particular type of person finds all this appealing. Content practicing Brahms and bailing hay. Casual, brainy, indifferent to sleep..Jon Wertheim: What else typifies a Deep Springs student?.Ziani Paiz: We're typically pretty awkward. In the real world, we're definitely not the cool kids. What else? We're not delicate, usually. We're not usually some delicate people..They can't be. Students are required to perform at least 20 hours of labor a week on top of a full college course load..Alice Owen took us through her routine maintaining irrigation lines. As we quickly learned, summer camp, this ain't..Jon Wertheim: This is significant hard, potentially dangerous labor. When people make mistakes, inevitably, what is the consequence of that?.Alice Owen: If I can't grow a field of alfalfa, then the cows will not have anything to eat. If you can't get dinner ready on time you have to apologize to people, and sometimes the mistakes are really hard to fix, or they're unfixable and then you just have to take the weight of, "well I, I messed up really big.".Alice Owen.Jon Wertheim: It seems sometimes today that colleges do everything they can to shield kids from discomfort, from hardship. That doesn't seem to be the philosophy here..Padraic MacLeish: No, it-- it absolutely isn't..That's Padraic MacLeish - a student here 20 years ago who was so entranced by this place, he came back to work as director of operations..Padraic MacLeish: If you want to finish the job before dinner you need to put some hustle in and work a little bit harder..Jon Wertheim: But why? What's the reasoning behind that?.Padraic MacLeish: What we are doing is trying to prepare them to live lives of service..Padraic MacLeish: When they see a problem, when they see something that needs to be done, you shouldn't go looking over your shoulder for somebody else to do that..Jon Wertheim: There's a self-reliance you get here..Padraic MacLeish: Exactly. I hope so anyway..Padraic MacLeish.Padraic is part of a motley crew of more than a dozen faculty and staff. The salary is modest compared to other schools, but food and housing are included and many live here with their families. Some come armed with Ph.D.s..Others with high school diplomas. Tim Gipson showed up here with his guitar five years ago, after running cattle from Montana to Texas..Jon Wertheim: These are some of the smartest kids in the country. Can you tell that when you're out here on the ranch?.Tim Gipson: Sometimes no [laugh]..As ranch manager, he fills a variety of roles. Among them, cowboy coach..Jon Wertheim: These kids could go to college almost anywhere in the country. Why would you do this?.Tim Gipson: One thing they have in common, almost all of the students that come here, is that they're searching for something different and unique. And they're really searching for a deeper meaning of life..Tim Gipson.It's a two-year school, after which, students usually transfer to finish their degrees at the most selective universities. Alumni include diplomats, Pulitzer Prize winners and famed physicists..Sarah Stickney: One of the classic things that happens to students when they come here is, they've been the best wherever they were. And suddenly, they're with 15 other people who have also been the best. And I think that's a hard moment for students..When we met her, Sarah Stickney was Deep Springs' dean..Jon Wertheim: I can't imagine they're easy to teach?.Sarah Stickney: Oh my gosh, they're magnificent to teach! They're much better than easy you know um, they have high standards. And they want a lot of attention, but not in a needy way, more like their own voraciousness and interest..Like everyone else, Stickney wasn't just teaching these students, she was part of their lives and lived just steps away, not that there are many options out here..Sarah Stickney.It's hard to exaggerate the remoteness of this place, but here's one indication: For years, the nearest drop point for students arriving by bus was about 50 miles away, on the other side of the Nevada state line, in front of a brothel. This extreme isolation formed one of the core principles for the school's founder LL Nunn, an eccentric electricity and mining baron who believed the desert held spiritual qualities and lacked the distractions and seductions of the real world. He bought an old ranch down in this valley and in 1917 christened Deep Springs College..Nunn, whose presence here is still ubiquitous, put up money for the school but specified the student body should be all male. It took a century, but three years ago, Deep Springs finally went coed and today, men women, everyone gets access to the free education at Deep Springs -- that's right, all the students here get a full ride..Among her many duties, President Sue Darlington raises money from alumni needed to keep this experiment going..Jon Wertheim: Does this place work if you charge tuition?.Sue Darlington: No..Jon Wertheim: Why not?.Sue Darlington: The students are not consumers. Therefore they're not turning around and saying, "I have the right to this because I've paid for this." Everybody is getting the same deal. And that levels a certain kind of playing field..Sue Darlington.The tradeoff: while other schools offer five-star amenities, here the trappings are, well, spare..Jon Wertheim: A lot of colleges and universities, they pride themselves on their facilities and the high tech and gym. You're laughing before I even finish the question..Sue Darlington: Yep..Jon Wertheim: That description does not apply here..Sue Darlington: Does not apply here. [laugh].Jon Wertheim: Describe the decor..Sue Darlington: [laugh] It's worn by the sand, the wind, the people. So we prioritize that everything works. And that the students also take some of the responsibility for the upkeep..And they take responsibility for running the school..Some rules are firm: students at Deep Springs can't drink or, except in rare circumstances, leave this valley during the semester. But just about everything else comes up for exhaustive debate, then a vote, in weekly student meetings that can make the U.S. Senate look efficient..Alice Owen: We spend our Friday nights having student body meetings..Alice Owen: We really do govern ourselves And-- and that can be-- tense, but ultimately it-- it can be a really exciting space, because the conversations that go on there are ones that have really high stakes for us..Students vote on matters essential and not. Dormitory decor and whether to allow 60 Minutes on campus..Also, which courses are offered and what professors they want to hire..And they sift through the 200 to 300 applications every year to pick the dozen-or-so students they'll accept for the incoming class..Jon Wertheim: Handing over power and authority to 18 and 19-year-old kids, it could lead to-- to "Animal House?" It could lead to "Lord of the Flies." But that doesn't seem to have happened here?.Sarah Stickney: Yeah. Yeah..Jon Wertheim: Why?.Sarah Stickney: Why do we imagine that giving people who are becoming adults authority and power in their own lives, why do we imagine that's a bad thing?.Jon Wertheim: The knee-jerk answer would be "life experience." And their-- and their response here might be, "Life experience?".Sarah Stickney: Right..Jon Wertheim: "I-- I'm out here with an irrigation contraption.".Sarah Stickney: Exactly..Jon Wertheim: "What's your life experience?".Sarah Stickney: Exactly..But from time to time, the adults have to step in. When COVID first hit the U.S., some students wanted the school to continue as usual in spite of California's lockdown. Administrators intervened, Padraic MacLeish among them..Jon Wertheim: Difficult conversation?.Padraic MacLeish: It wasn't an easy one, but it was an important one. You know, defining the limits of self-governance are part of talking about what self-governance actually means at Deep Springs..And speaking of experiences not offered at State-U, Ziani Paiz was preparing for an adventure: driving cattle on horseback up a remote mountain top for summer grazing..Ziani Paiz: We're gonna chase them up. We'll keep them where they need to be. We'll work long hours. We'll read sometimes..It fell to Tim Gipson to get her ready for that journey..Jon Wertheim: We talked to Ziani She'd never been on a horse, barely, before she-- she got here..Tim Gipson: [laugh] She's from East LA….Jon Wertheim: How'd you swing that one?.Tim Gipson: Now, she had a lot of try, a lot of determination.

This level of participation in corporate life, is sometimes even difficult to find at the Board level of a corporation (where culture may mean such matters are in the hands of a few)..FWIW, it is certainly neither a cruise ship, nor a continual party, to use some of the more pejorative characterizations of institutions today. DSers are generally expected to have a seriousness of purpose, a sober manner, and to participate actively in every aspect of running the institution-- from making sure the floors are clean and the alfalfa planted, to hiring the faculty and crafting the curriculum..Upvote.·.99.12.Related questions.What are the requirements for admission to Deep Springs College for international students?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.What is the best way to get into Deep Springs College as a transfer?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.What makes Deep Springs College so elite?.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.Do college students still attend Deep Springs?

But since the first year was the.same.for all three majors (except for an additional course for engineering majors), I applied for engineering as my “expected” major. I made the formal choice in the middle of that first year..My first academic appointment was at Harvey Mudd College - a highly selective undergraduate college of science and engineering. At the time, there were only four majors (Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering). The general education courses could either be taken at HMC or the sister colleges in the other Claremont Colleges. The first year and a half of that program was identical for all four majors. Even though a student might identify their.preference.upon entrance, the formal choice was not made until the middle of their second year..But most of my career was at a large (mostly undergraduate) comprehensive state university - with emphasis on technical programs (the sciences, engineering, architecture, etc.) But there were multiple majors within each of those colleges as well as agriculture, the humanities and liberal arts, etc. That university required that students.apply.to a specific major - and their acceptance depended on the competition for available spots within each major. That was done, I think at least in part, so that each program (the individual majors) could start with sequence courses within that major even though many of the course sequences were similar across majors. So if a student wanted to be an engineer, for example, they had to decide while still in high school whether they should go into mechanical or electrical or materials or computer or packaging or who knows what engineering program, long before they really knew what the differences would be or how to decide..Of course, if a student was accepted into a program they later decided they did not want to major in, transfers to other majors were possible - as long as that student was in good standing.and.the other department was not already impacted. But if a student was not doing well in their original choice of major, it might become very difficult for them to transfer into a program they.did.realize was better for them..That long answer was to explain what I meant by “It depends on the college or university.” Some institutions have “undecided” as a category on can apply to - and in my opinion, they.should.. It would give students some time to get settled into the college environment, learn how to study and how to manage their time - and explore one or two areas of interest before choosing a major. But I don’t think “undecided” would make an easier acceptance path in most places. That it, it can come across as implying a student wants to be a college kid to find themselves rather than build on the academic strengths they already have. That said, I’m sure there are some colleges and universities for which that is an acceptable path for all students.

Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR..If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so..Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate., if you’re interested..See if you qualify for debt relief..2. Not getting a financial advisor..99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake..Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time..People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year.(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time..But more important:.a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of.If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like.WiserAdvisor.) and find somebody near you that has good reviews..Or if you want something easier,.here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs..3. Not using an ad blocker..If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am.begging.you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life..A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet..No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible..Most people I know use Total Adblock (.link here.) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options..Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice..Here’s a link to Total Adblock., if you’re interested..4. Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year..The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance..Check out a site like.Coverage.com.to compare the best car insurance options available..Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today..See how much you could save..5. Getting price gouged on the internet..You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere..Big stores like Amazon know that.no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites., so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices..I typically.hate.browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have.Capital One Shopping.installed yet, do yourself a favor and.grab it...Here’s what I mean:.I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back. Amazon’s price was $95..(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example).That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)..It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once..Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping., if you want..6. Not getting paid for your opinions..As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)..I usually use Branded Surveys (.link here.). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV..Here's the form I used to sign up.- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops..7. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)..It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)..Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (.Ark7.is one of our favorites)..They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account..It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)..If you’re interested,.take a look at Ark7’s properties here..8. Not getting paid for your screentime..There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)..I typically use.TesterUp., but there are others too. It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you. I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly..Here’s a link to the app..Hope that helps someone!.Upvote.·.5.9K.5.9K.999.268.999.141.Related questions.Is it easier to get into a top college with certain majors?.If a college application asks as what major I want to study, will selecting certain majors hurt my chances, or will admissions not care what I choose?.What is the easiest major to get into college and why?.Does putting down undecided instead of a core major increase your chances of acceptance into college?.Will applying for a smaller and uncommon major increase my chances of college admission?.Do majors affect admissions when applying to a college?.Will applying for an uncommonly studied major at a college famous for a certain subject increase my chances of getting in there?.Does a student have a better chance of getting into a college if the program they are applying to is a new major?.What are the advantages/disadvantages of applying to college with a major (instead of applying undecided)?

Kenneth Thomas's answer to Is Deep Springs College as unparalleled as the media reported? - Quora.Something went wrong. Wait a moment and try again..Try again.Skip to content.Skip to search.Sign In.Is Deep Springs College as unparalleled as the media reported?.Kenneth Thomas.Studied at.Deep Springs College.·.Author has.4.1K.answers and.5M.answer views.·.8y.·.Answering directly to the question:   Deep Springs is the only institution in the United States with admissions statistics higher than Caltech..The year before I attended Deep Springs,   the Curriculum Committee (which is composed primarily of students) interviewed Stephen Jay Gould for a position.   He later described the experience as extremely rigorous -- they did not simply assume he was qualified,  but grilled him extensively on his work,  teaching methods and how he would fit into Deep Springs..I understand that,  due to coverage a few years ago,  awareness of Deep Springs is now growing in China.  This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".4.4K views.·.View upvotes.·.Answer requested by.Ruairi Atack.1 of 5 answers.Comments.View.4.other answers to this question.About the Author.Kenneth Thomas.Former CTO.1998–2001.Studied at.Deep Springs College.Lives in.Earth.5.1M content views.57.3K this month.Active in 3 Spaces.Knows.French.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

It is truly a unique educational experience, and a place too few prospective student are likely aware of. If I had known about it when I was 18, and there had been no draft to consider, I would have applied.

Deep Springs is probably most like Caltech in that it is small, very highly selective, generous with financial aid and students bond over shared experiences which the outside world doesn't understand. That said, Deep Springs is completely unlike any of those institutions..Deep Springs is small: its 25 students wouldn't fill one residence hall (hovse) at Caltech..Deep Springs is isolated: the college occupies a desert valley in eastern California between Los Angeles and Reno, many miles from the nearest town, Big Pine, California and the (student-enforced) Isolation Policy restricts outside interactions..Deep Springs Students have an unusual amount of control over the college: an elected student Trustee is a full voting member of the small board of trustees. The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation. I am the only member of my class with an occupation even remotely related to agriculture (I am a retired veterinarian): others are MDs, lawyers, college professors, artists and writers..You can see the Milky Way on any moonless night; not true of any of the other colleges I have been to..Upvote.·.99.35.9.2.Wayne Uejio.computer programmer/mathematician, system architecture, system architect,.·.Author has.787.answers and.1.1M.answer views.·.10y.Related.What do you know about Deep Springs College?.The son of a friend of mine went there.  It only accepts roughly 20 students per year and is a 2 year school.  There is no tuition and no charge for room and board.  You have to work on the ranch.  The profs and students live and eat together.  Most of the students transfer with no trouble to minor schools like Yale, Harvard, MIT, Cal Tech, etc..It has an excellent reputation within the educational community.

He later described the experience as extremely rigorous -- they did not simply assume he was qualified,  but grilled him extensively on his work,  teaching methods and how he would fit into Deep Springs..I understand that,  due to coverage a few years ago,  awareness of Deep Springs is now growing in China.  This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".Upvote.·.99.13.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet..Upvote.·.999.410.999.121.99.18.Related questions.What does it take to be accepted at Deep Springs College?.How has Deep Springs College changed since it became coed?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.Where did you go, and what did you do after attending Deep Springs College?.Can any Deep Springs College alumni tell me what the most fulfilling part of their experience was?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.Do you have any ideas on Deep Springs College?.Are there any Deep Springs alumni on Quora?.What is the best way to get into Deep Springs College as a transfer?.Are there any international students at Deep Springs College?.What makes Deep Springs College so elite?.What is it like to attend Deep Springs College?.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.Is it good to study at Deep Springs College for a Master's?.What do you know about Deep Springs College?.Related questions.What does it take to be accepted at Deep Springs College?.How has Deep Springs College changed since it became coed?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.Where did you go, and what did you do after attending Deep Springs College?.Can any Deep Springs College alumni tell me what the most fulfilling part of their experience was?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.Advertisement.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

Spencer has an established record of helping test takers at all score levels achieve their goals..Michaela Jones.Michaela was a National Merit finalist with a perfect score in English and above 700 in reading and math on the SAT, which earned her a full tuition scholarship at Barrett, the Honors College at ASU. During tutorials, Michaela likes to approach things with a sense of humor. She likes to think that her positive, can-do attitude is contagious, and maybe one of her SAT students said it best: “not gonna lie, this has kinda been fun.”.Dave MacKenzie.Dave has been tutoring since high school and was a T.A. while in undergrad and grad school. He acted as a T.A. for physics and math courses, was a lab demonstrator, a tutorial host, and has lectured at the university level.

Outside of teaching, he enjoys reading, playing music, and cheering for the Montreal Canadiens..Valerie Meyers.Valerie is from Long Island and moved to NYC to work in “Big Law”, where she was also an Adjunct Professor of Legal Writing at Cardozo Law School.

This is why we have thrived for over 35+ years..Spencer LeDoux.Spencer has had a varied career spanning banking, retail, and university education both at home and abroad. His first major teaching job was as an English instructor in Osaka, Japan. He has a knack for identifying and removing barriers that students have when learning how to take standardized tests. Spencer has an established record of helping test takers at all score levels achieve their goals..Michaela Jones.Michaela was a National Merit finalist with a perfect score in English and above 700 in reading and math on the SAT, which earned her a full tuition scholarship at Barrett, the Honors College at ASU. During tutorials, Michaela likes to approach things with a sense of humor. She likes to think that her positive, can-do attitude is contagious, and maybe one of her SAT students said it best: “not gonna lie, this has kinda been fun.”.Valerie Meyers.Valerie is from Long Island and moved to NYC to work in “Big Law”, where she was also an Adjunct Professor of Legal Writing at Cardozo Law School. After working in law, she moved to NJ to become the manager of a medical practice, putting her MBA to work! After 22 years, she retired and found an opportunity to do something that she really enjoys, teaching. Her tutoring philosophy is that she is here to help students achieve their goals..Daniel M. Almeida.Daniel has experience teaching and tutoring at all levels of education and has thus encountered students employing a broad spectrum of learning styles. Daniel holds an HBSc with High Distinction from the University of Toronto. During his undergraduate education he specialized in Integrative Physiology and majored in Behavioural Neuroscience. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience and Psychiatry at McGill University..Jerry Dresner.Jerry was making the transition from practicing law to teaching when he began teaching for The Princeton Review in 1996. He then spent 21 years as a high school social studies teacher, specializing in AP U.S. History, AP Psychology, AP World History, and AP U.S. Government & Politics. Over the past 22 years he has prepared hundreds of students for the SAT, PSAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and MCAT using TPR's proven methods..Kathy Ruppert.Kathy previously worked for The Princeton Review as a classroom instructor and master tutor for the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, and MCAT (verbal) and eventually as a master trainer for the SAT and SES programs. After a nine-year hiatus to teach history full-time, she is delighted to be back with TPR once again. She loves to travel, play platform tennis, and spend time with her kids.

He acted as a T.A. for physics and math courses, was a lab demonstrator, a tutorial host, and has lectured at the university level. For Dave, the only thing more rewarding than learning a new topic and acing a test is helping others to do the same. Outside of teaching, he enjoys reading, playing music, and cheering for the Montreal Canadiens..Valerie Meyers.Valerie is from Long Island and moved to NYC to work in “Big Law”, where she was also an Adjunct Professor of Legal Writing at Cardozo Law School.

The diversity of insights and styles gives a look at the varied individual experiences of Deep Springs College..Lana Mahbouba (DS21).My first two years of college have been enlightening, freeing, painful, and dense..Due to the smallness of the Deep Springs community, my classmates and I are in consistent contact. We rub against each other, and eventually smooth one another out. I soon realized that no matter where our relationship was, these people would always be there for me when I needed support, and I should do the same for them a thousand times over. At Deep Springs, you can’t block someone you dislike..And so the next best thing is to hike out far enough from campus and face the other direction. Standing alone against the wind and mountains provides a visceral reset. Our greatest challenge lies in building unconditional self worth in order to be a better community member to these people..When I returned for my second year, I kissed my classmates’ heads after I braided their hair during student body meetings. I know that these people are family. Through repetitive contact, I came to understand them. And in understanding them, I see the goodness in them. When my humanity disgusts me, they hold me. And in the desert valley dip, the Inyo-White Mountains hold us. I hope to internalize the spaciousness and quietness of the valley and mountains of my current home to give to those I meet post Deep Springs. Where we are is who we are—and for me, I became a woman amidst our mountains..Jesus Munoz (DS15).My time at Deep Springs College was a transforming experience. There is something unique about this place: it’s where I learned the powerful value of higher education. I went to an inner-city public high school, and I thought that a college education was only worth pursuing for its practical value. At Deep Springs, I realized that a higher education means more than a mere degree: it is a journey of self-discovery that leads to a meaningful life. This journey, however, is not easy. The three pedagogical pillars at Deep Springs (academics, self-governance, and labor) taught me that scholarly knowledge is not enough for a wholesome education..There is something special about Deep Springs: its tight-knit community provides strong support for students. Indeed, this place is challenging, but the community reaches out to students and helps them get through difficult times. I made meaningful relationships with many people in the community, and some of them had an influential impact in my personal and intellectual life. I am double majoring in politics and philosophy at Pomona College, and I can confidently say that my Deep Springs education gave a new meaning to my studies, one that teaches me to find joy in learning, even in times of adversity..Izzy Pisarsky (DS18).I have an hour and thirteen minutes to complete my short story for Sarah’s class. I’m trying to justify the details, so that they don’t.only.pertain to Deep Springs. Why do all my characters’ jackets have chicken blood on them? Why do they roll their cigarettes with bible paper? Why do they use Robert’s Rules to decide on which snack to buy? Seven minutes before the deadline I give up masking my solipsism and close my computer..I have labor and not eaten lunch yet, so I run into the boarding house and grab a still-warm tamale from the leftover fridge. I commend our BH crew who chose to wash dishes to Taylor Swift’s “Red” on repeat—it’s One Song Wednesday..On farm team, we have spent the last week driving out to one
of the fields, trying to battle the Russian thistle. It’s not the sexiest labor
(climbing into the dump truck, trying to stomp down the thistle and, instead, sinking
knee-deep into the prickles) but it has to be done. We want to regrow native
grass to outcompete the tumbleweed. When we finish forking up the thistle that
we heaped up like massive funeral pyres, Gabriel, our farm manager, asks us for
one more thing. We climb over the dormant irrigation lines into the field. Squatting
down in the middle of it, he makes us take off our gloves. With his hands in
the soil, he tells us about the energy that the earth gives us, how we
shouldn’t forget to come out here during finals, how this is where we are from
and where we’ll go to. He lets us put our faces into the grass, and breathe in
the musty cool smell. His dogs try to lick our necks as we lie there..On our way back, we all sit in the back of Gabriel’s truck, dirt on our cheeks. I smile at the sun that sends out its last rays from behind the Sierra, and I remember that I love this valley. But then, I also remember that I forgot to call my parents, yet again. That I meant to take the pictures for our next Deep Springs calendar but now the sun is gone. That I forgot to compile the Euro trash playlist for our end-of-term boogie and still wanted to make cookies for the application grading labor party tonight..Aadit Narula Gupta (DS17).It’s difficult to write about Deep Springs in a way that’s intelligible to prospective applicants comparing great schools, because the College defies a conventional vocabulary. Deep Springs isn’t trying to be compared to any other institution, and as an experience for its students, it occupies a category of its own..The desert valley in which we live is core to life here. It is barren, rugged, and remote. Bishop, the nearest town of consequential size, is an hour’s drive away over a mountain pass. Our remoteness promotes a serious and deliberate self-reliance: students here spend 20 hours per week cooking meals, cleaning toilets, butchering, building, farming and ranching. They consciously choose to spend two years attending seminar classes or give public speeches with little time in between labor and academic work to wash off collected dirt or dried animal blood. Modern city living can seem planets away, and residents’ sincere commitments to Deep Springs as a living project stems largely from this fact. Students forgo drugs and alcohol, and often stay in the Valley over breaks to take care of the cattle instead of going home—building a tangible connection to the environment and space around them, and to the people they come to rely upon..The Student Body’s (SB’s) policy of self-enforced isolation makes for a truly unique student life. Living at Deep Springs can at times look—from the outside—like a fictionalized pastoral ideal. The vast, empty expanse in which we live inspires a sense of loneliness and pressure to introspect, but also a profound sense of community and mutual reliance. Because the school attracts students who are intellectually engaged and purpose-driven both inside and outside of the classroom, the ample opportunities to be lonely here inspire reflection, and not necessarily hardship. Our camaraderie is strong and genuine..Deep Springs offers a rigorous and top-tier liberal arts curriculum—not too dissimilar from those offered by other elite schools across the US—but students here experience it in the context of a compact intellectual village, where, because we number only thirty, interpersonal relationships tend to be close and deep. The student body’s small size and diversity of scholarly focus makes for an intense dialectical culture. Much of our academic discussions happen in our free time, and the SB as a group often engages important moral and philosophical questions as we jointly exercise self-governance..Our model of self-governance makes this community a rare example of direct democracy in practice. In students’ capacity as beneficial owners of the school and its property, we make wide-ranging and impactful decisions about the way we live and what we do with our resources; decisions which can range as widely as the selection of faculty, offered courses, and new students, to the maintenance of the ground rules and the allocation of funds for building projects..I’d describe my personal experience of Deep Springs as at once life-changing, severe, and yet, at times, even blissful or relaxing. After six-hour cattle drives in the baking heat, or successive nights of little sleep with papers to write and applicants’ essays to read, I find that focusing on anything but the need to keep on keeping on can be difficult. But, I will say—believing it wholeheartedly—that life is only satisfying when it’s lived with direction, and against exceptional challenges. Of course, it certainly helps when you have the chance to wake up every morning to one of the most arrestingly beautiful views on the planet; when you eat better than you have ever done in your life (and perhaps ever will); and when there are calves to pet on demand. That is life at Deep Springs..Tanner Loper (DS17.).I grew up traveling all around the world with the military, but I like to say that Virginia is my home. Coming to Deep Springs from a high school system that emphasized and epitomized a STEM education presented its challenges. It was difficult to get the hang of seminar-style classes at first. It didn’t take long, however, for me to start to discover my voice both inside and outside of the classroom. I also find myself increasingly involved in the daily cooperative quest for philosophical discovery (a bit pretentious?)..I worked part-time jobs since tenth grade, but the labor program has provided me with new and meaningful challenges. These have ranged from baking bread for the community to getting bulls back in their pens. The self-governance program has taught me about what it means to live cooperatively and considerately in a diverse political community..Most of all, though, I think I’ll cherish my years here for two reasons: Friends and Growth. I have had time to get to know some of the kindest, most thoughtful people I’ve ever met. They have made the good times great and the bad times easier to get through. On bad times, Deep Springs has given me some of the most personally challenging days and weeks of my life, but I find I come out of each one a little stronger and a little better prepared for whatever comes next..Robert Gunn (DS16).My experiences at Deep Springs have proven to modulate something that I already knew before coming here—that there really isn’t the time to do and learn anything and everything that I’d like to, be it in a day, a week, or a lifetime. But rather than just augment that truism, these experiences have added a few more fugal voices to create a harmony that is ultimately both romantic and frustrating..I usually have an urge to learn and read about anything I can get my hands on, yet here and now, more than at most points in the past, in a place dedicated to intense thought, I feel the time constraints that show time efficiency’s limitations. Beyond that limit, a value judgment comes in: what will I prioritize with what time I do have. In few other areas of life here do I feel that more than with academics..Academics at Deep Springs provide opportunities that are difficult to find in virtually any other circumstance.  Small classes of five to ten others whom I know and engage with individually day-in-and-out in labor, self-governance, and social spaces, and who actually do the readings assigned to them and have things to say about it, are not easy to find elsewhere..I find seminar spaces can be a grind at times—here comes the cheesy comparison to fugues once more—a room with that many voices can be difficult to synchronize and keep together without central organization, but those moments when we learn to think of the whole before ourselves such that the dialogue between voices is put above the virtue of any individual voice—when the individuals melt into something larger—are the moments that not only make up for the occasional grind, but point to the beauty of much of what there is to learn here. Much of DS is an odd balance of autonomy and self-sacrifice for something that’s tangible on one level but elusive and mysterious on another. Even when I don’t have as much time to do all the things I’d like to, I do have time to help create a beautiful conversation in class. Whether that be excitedly speculating on the decision procedures within various ant species in Eusociality, deciphering the aphoristic propositions of Wittgenstein, or battling over whether the concept of judicial review should be given as much weight as it does in American political institutions and thought during Constitutional Law, those moments of questioning can be powerful..Sometimes class discussions can fall short, but unlike most educational institutions, it feels that far more of the onus is on every single person that steps into that room twice a week for 90-minutes to create something outside of themselves. My past lifetime experiences in classrooms have ranged between redefining a part of my sense of the world on the positive end and making me hate learning on the negative, but the project at Deep Springs asks me to do something else. It asks me to think about the grade I will be receiving second and to think about the ideas being floated, challenged and built around first—to love the pursuit not as a solitary venture, but as a joint venture with equals..Michael Leger (DS16).“Farm” was first described to me as a heroic labour position at Deep Springs. Running through fields of alfalfa with a hammer in hand, banging on pipes and clamps of metal until they meet your will, and occasionally, (or not so occasionally) yelling into the sky or at the irrigation lines whenever they resist compliance. On some days this romantic ideal of what “farm” is aligns with reality. On these days I wake up at 5:30am primed to run, work hard, and release energy. Some days there are coyotes in the fields rummaging for food, and when they howl or look at me, I howl back at them. On these days I might even look out and appreciate the beautiful landscape—the valley cast in pink light as the sun peeks over the mountains..But other days—most days, in fact—the romantic ideal of “farm” is nowhere to be found. This is when I inadvertently sleep in a little too late, when my other farm-teamers forget to check on me and wake me up, and when I’m left to start labour late and am already a little too frustrated. Too many times on these days I neglect the smaller duties of farm—such as fixing a line that’s not as straight as it could be—because I’m feeling lazy or in a rush, or want to finish my readings for class, only to find out that over time that small problem has developed into a far greater one. I’m then in a position of having to ask my fellow farm-teamers to help me out for an extra few hours midday in the sweltering heat to re-build a whole line. This has happened many times, and it is frustrating..Over the past term, I’ve been mad at myself for taking shortcuts out of laziness, and also frustrated with other farm-teamers for various reasons, some more justifiable than others. Quite honestly, I don’t know what else other than my experience on farm team has been able to make me so immediately frustrated. It’s almost impressive. I’ve often found myself standing in the middle of the field, impatient with a dysfunctional motor, blaming my frustration on anything other than my own actions..But actually, reflecting on how I treat myself in these circumstances—wondering whether I should fix a particular sprinkler in the moment, or later, reflecting on how I communicate with other farm-teamers when I’m in a good mood or a bad mood—has proved to be a challenging and fulfilling experience full of self-reflection. Although there is a certain peace and ease when everything is going well, when my experience meets the expectation of the heroic, I’ve found that there is actually a more intriguing experience to be had when nothing works as planned.  Perhaps the best moments arise when everything is broken and you’re forced to reckon with yourself and your peers..Jonathan Zisk (DS16).Over Term 1-2 break, seven intrepid Deep Springers set off together to explore the Sierra Nevada Mountains—the very peaks we had gazed at every day beyond the crest of our valley during Term One. For all of us, it was an opportunity to elucidate our thoughts on the last term, and build upon our evolving friendships..Heading out from South Lake, we first noticed the crisp air and forests of lodgepole pines.  Everything was green and full of life; water trickled from snowfields and glaciers to fill deep, aquamarine alpine lakes, surrounded by soft beds of moss and granite slabs perfect for camping..The thin atmosphere up high opened our lungs and frosted the tips of our sleeping bags at night, but more importantly, it cleared our minds. After a busy Term One and Summer Seminar at the college, there was nothing better than waking up—while the sun pierced through the gaps in craggy peaks—to jump into a frigid lake, shocking our bodies as we witnessed each beautiful Sierra morning. Throughout the trip, we hiked through Inyo National Forest and Kings Canyon National Park. We climbed down into canyons, up over boulder-strewn passes, and summited the nearly 14,000’ Mt. Agassiz..But the most memorable moments of the trip were hidden in our down time: reading, exploring, debating, and enjoying each other’s company amidst towering white cathedrals. In the evenings we made simple meals together, and witnessed the transient moment when the tallest mountains are crowned with rosy alpenglow..On our final morning, after we reluctantly turned back to meet our ride, we passed back through the scree fields and below the tree line. There, where the mountains nurture rich forest floors, the cold nights had infused the hollow with the first smell of fall, and with it, the first thought of Term Two..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

What is Deep Springs like? What kind of students attend the school?., though I didn't exactly answer either question (just, free writing).."Would that every college be situated thus," wrote Thoreau, "at the base of a mountain." About Williams. But it's even more true about Deep Springs (DS)..Transformational, yes. It seems to me almost impossible to leave DS, without a deep sense of personal responsibility for the things around you-- and of your ability to act to change them-- where most people would give up or not bother..In a nation self-obsessed with bigness, DS is small enough that individuals can have impact-- and that the consequences of actions, especially on others, are or become clear. There are few places, outside a monastery, where you have the opportunity to get to know people (and get to know how people act!) quite so well..I once calculated that I had spend a few thousand hours in the same room with about ten classmates from Williams-- over four years. At Deep Springs, you will exceed that with almost everyone there, in a half year..Some people won't spend that kind of time with their spouse or child..Thus, I'm not as clear about DS attracting misanthropes. Williams, probably had as many misanthropes or more by percentage-- it was just easier for them to hide in the crowd! I'd worry, too many misogynists, as long as DS remains all-male. Certainly, DS attracts and sustains people who are atypical, both in ability, and perspective-- as well as neuroatypical, who simply "think differently--" and of course, can be very assertive in their difference..There is a phrase about monasteries, that asserts the monks are like stones in a bag-- rubbed smooth, against the personalities of the other monks. It also has been applied to DS. And it applies to conflicts, which can range from the petty and the personal, to the reality that you just can't escape the consequences of your actions at DS..Otherwise-- DS is a community of 25 or so students, 60 or so total individuals, isolated in a desert valley about the size of Manhattan. I repeat myself: Good or bad, it's very hard to escape the consequences of one's actions, including the impact of one's decisions on others, in such a small cauldron..Despite the all-male component, I'd say it is relatively hard for males in such an environment, for young men, to maintain the relative emotional and interpersonal obliviousness, common in men in the US. It is all-too-easy, for them to remain not just naive, but clueless and awkward and negative towards women..Given the permissiveness and chaos of gender relations at many institutions, this can also play out positively, as well..You get to know people, you notice the nuance and effect of small things. And you notice-- or are held to account-- if your work doesn't measure up, or it brings consequences or more work, to others..Many find the isolation-- not just physical, but from TV and other media, "lonely." The tasks of self-governance of operations, in real circumstances, of course lead to heightened personal conflicts and often difficulties-- among people who are generally relatively immature..At a Williams, if you have a beef with someone, you can easily avoid it for a while-- or for years. At Deep Springs, if you want to avoid someone that you work and study alongside everyday, you have the option of walking off into the desert-- and someone is going to complain, they had to pick up your slack..Not that everything gets worked out, at all..Transformative indeed, among a mass society, in which responsibility and consequences, especially in interpersonal relationships, is so often, so easy to blithely ignore or walk away from..The direct opposite of modern anomie, then, if you'll allow me to overemphasize the positive..Upvote.·.99.12.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify.

You may have seen some AMA's about the school a couple years ago, but much has changed since then. First of all, we're co-ed! Second, we accept international students! I just had a.very.successful AMA over on the A2C Discord server, where I think we broke the record for most questions in a single session, which makes sense because Deep Springs is an admittedly strange, and actually fantastic place that I want to share with as many people as possible. I'll give a brief summary of the school, but here's a shameless plug of.our website.for some basic information..Here's what makes Deep Springs different and one of the best opportunities in higher education:.Every student receives a 100% scholarship. No catch. The reasoning is that you are fundamentally making your education, not buying it (you'll see how soon)..There are only 26 students. I assume this is where the "are you guys a cult???" question comes from. Just because we're small doesn't mean that we're not fully accredited as a two-year institution, though..Students do everything. Who's gonna milk the cows? Students. Who's gonna harvest the vegetables?  Students. Who's gonna hire the professors? Students. Who's gonna drive the cows through the mountains? Students. Who's gonna start a digital outreach campaign? Students (me)..The location is extremely isolated and there are no drugs or alcohol. This is sometimes hard, and I can answer questions about the internet, escapism, and anything you want on this issue if you want. For now, I'll just say that we're on one of the biggest college campuses in the world: our valley is the size of two Manhattans. I can't put a picture here (maybe I just don't remember how to use Reddit after so much time in the desert), but check out my profile for some beauties..Please, when it comes to Deep Springs, there is no such thing as a stupid question, so ask away! I'll start answering today (10/17) at 12:00 PST or 3:00 EST..Thanks so much for having me!.Max, DS'22.Read more.Add a Comment.Sort by:.Q&A.Open comment sort options.Best.Top.New.Controversial.Old.Q&A.AutoModerator.•.9mo ago.Moderator Announcement.Read More ».This AMA has been verified by the A2C moderation team..I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a lot of book discussion. What I see you have for STEM is far less than a community college. That is kind of limiting..The STEM classes mainly come in two flavors. There are classes that discuss a centuries-old historical book like Elements or Principia, and there are classes that provide a superficial overview of something like cryptography or special relativity. Nothing seems to have any prerequisites, so you can't get to advanced material. It's 7-week classes, and you take a bunch at once, so the classes can't go too deep..Looking at just the recent two years, to avoid the COVID years and because Deep Springs is a 2-year school:.Cryptography: History and Algorithms (history and a bit of Python).Technological MacGyverying with the Arduino (lightweight treatment).Heavenly Mathematics (it's trigonometry).Modeling, Rendering, and Simulation (introduction to Java).Observational Astronomy (use a telescope).Thermodynamics and Earth Systems, Local to Global (superficial, with very limited math).A Modern Mass Extinction (uses an AP Environmental Science book).Combinatorics (about 25% of a statistics class or discrete math class).From Galileo to Newton: The Emergence of Modern Physical Science (Newton’s Principia).Numerical Analysis on a Pocket Calculator (how math operations are implemented).Cosmology and Black Holes (literally says "bypass a lot of advanced mathematics").Real Analysis (the history of discovery, not actually doing it).Some of those course titles look great, but the descriptions reveal something different. I sure hope nobody gets transfer credit for a genuine Real Analysis class after studying the discovery of it at Deep Springs..Missing:.calculus 1.calculus 2.calculus 3 (multivariate).differential equations.linear algebra (saw it, but not in the last 2 years).discrete.statistics.chemistry.physics, mostly (Principia isn't all you need).biology.Outside of STEM, I notice a stunning lack of economics. Economics is fundamental to understanding a lot of things about our world.

I finished with a 2.3 gpa and I actually didnt even know if I was graduating until our class was 3 days from walking. That isn't to say that I was dumb, I scored a 2250 on my SAT and I didn't even study for it. I just didn't take high school very seriously..Needless to say, my only option was to attend a community college. I settled on going to De Anza, a community college in Cupertino, that happened to be one of the best community colleges in the country, despite the fact that 4 community colleges were closer. My commute was a 2 1/2 hour bus ride; my parents refused to let me borrow one of their cars because they thought that I was an idiot for going so far for school..I decided to major in computer science, and really enjoyed the classes. For the first time in my life, I took my classes seriously, and I had to sign up for a grand total of just 3 classes I had no interest in. I did really well, and I had a perfect 4.0 gpa after my first year. I ended up applying to a lot of colleges and I got accepted by quite a few. Some of the really big schools that accepted me: Stanford, Harvard, Cal tech, University of Chicago, Cornell, UCLA, and UC Berekley..I now attend Harvard, and while there is a stigma of being a transfer student at Harvard (some fellow classmates look down on me because I'm a transfer student), most people are pretty cool and nice..Tldr: Yes, you can get into any college you would like to as a transfer student, but you might have to work very hard and you might be unhappy with the stigma that comes from being a transfer student..Upvote.·.99.62.9.7.9.1.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet..Upvote.·.999.410.999.121.99.18.Related questions.More answers below.Why do elite colleges accept more transfers from community colleges?.Is it considered easier to be accepted to top colleges as a transfer student?

For one thing, students in those schools usually have an entire network of support, like parents, counselors, tutors, environment, values, etc., that all work synergistically to provide an atmosphere to excel in school.

This may have been the case even before high school, for example, middle school or grade school. What I recommend is to try and duplicate the types of advantages many of these students have. If your family isn’t highly educated, hang out with people that have highly educated families. Find out where and what the college oriented kids are doing—not the cool kids. Even in ‘average’ high schools, there are plenty of students that do well academically, and even more importantly, enjoy school. Figure out how you can enjoy school. That doesn’t mean walking around grinning all the time, but it means growing comfortable within the school/knowledge environment. It is a lot easier to enjoy it if you have support from others. You don’t need money to do these things. Focus on subjects in school that you like. Join clubs with like minded students. Figure out how to get free tutoring. Hang around the teachers you think are good, and know their stuff. Eventually, you will get into the ‘groove’ of academics. It isn’t hard if you are motivated. It’s only hard if you don’t really want to do what you’re doing. You’re just as capable as anyone. The fact that you raised this question shows that you are interested in helping yourself. You will do just fine. Besides that, what is a ‘top college’ anyway?

Interestingly enough, the five page essay is not only a long winded, run on sentence describing the many crazy occurrences at the ranch, but actually part of the title itself (as it is separated by a colon)..From what is said in the essay, Deep Springs is either the weirdest and most successful 2-year college in the U.S, or a cult disguising itself as just another "farmland college" (kidding).

There are no special deadlines or processes for transfer students, but they must submit transcripts from their college-level careers in addition to secondary school transcripts. Regardless of prior college experience, every student enters Deep Springs as a “first-year.”.The full-scholarship for tuition, room, and board is awarded automatically to all admitted students, regardless of financial need, country of origin, or any other considerations. Admitted students in financial need can consult with the Academic Dean to receive funding assistance for books, travel, and incidental expenses..International Students.For international students, the application process is like the application process for domestic students, with one major exception: If an applicant has not attended an English-speaking secondary school or college, we ask for proof of English proficiency through the TOEFL, the IELTS, Duolingo, or other equivalent exam.

Depending on the year, ApCom might treat test scores differently, but I'd keep in mind that ApCom consists almost entirely of students who also took the tests you're taking and went through the stress you're going through when you're applying to college. If you were part of the second round this year, your application file consisted of at least ten essays, one in-person essay, a 50 minute interview, and your presence during your five day long visit, your grades, and your test scores. Test scores are only a part of a long process..Reply.reply.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.•.Deep Springs College Admission AMA.deepspringsapcom.replied to.BoyWithACrown.1 mo. ago.1 Most students choose not to see their grades until they need to, which is usually when they begin the college transfer process. This isn't because we don't care about our academic performance (hopefully my answers above are at least indicative of that fact). We put a lot of care into writing about each other's performance in all three pillars multiple times per year, and the first person to call you out for slacking off in academics, labor, or self-governance will almost always be another student. Compared with a two-hour long conversation with a friend or a page long reflection from a different friend, why would I ever look at as basic a metric as a letter grade?.2 Rebecca helped me out on this one above somewhere. There are a few trans students and a few lgbt students here right now, and there will be a few next year. From conversations with them and from speeches they've given about their identities, I believe Deep Springs is pretty accepting in this regard..3 The dorms are beautiful, in theory. There's not a lot of time to clean them with all the work we have to do, so they can often get dirty. Most rooms house three people, and most rooms are part of a two-room suite with a shared bathroom. They are co-ed, but the gender mixture also depends on your preference. The rooms are quite spacious and filled with wonderful decorations of sorts. You can feel that you're in a room that's been modeled by generations of Deep Springers going through the same things you are. I currently live in an elevated loft with a slide to the floor..4 Yes.

It's also tough because my eight year old self would have no interest in college at all..Generally in my work on the admissions committee, I appreciate someone who reads. Not just the books in school, not just the books that they agree with wholeheartedly, but someone who treats each book as a means to reach another book, to complicate one of their core presumptions about the world, to be disturbed and then resolve that disturbance. I appreciate an applicant who would agree with Kafka when he said "If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for?" Blows lead to more blows; books lead to more books. If you're willing to go down that path in childhood than you're likely a good fit for the kind of education Deep Springs will provide..But this isn't the only path by any stretch. There's a way to get here without having read much at all in high school. Maybe you got really good at a particular skill and taught others. Maybe you protested an injustice. I don't know, at this point I'd just be thinking of people I know and describing their biographies. Maybe all I know is that it's helpful to want to go to Deep Springs to get in, but if you're defining yourself by that desire, than you're a bit misguided..Reply.reply.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.•.Deep Springs College Admission AMA.deepspringsapcom.replied to.Consistent-Assist582.1 mo. ago.True..Reply.reply.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.•.Deep Springs College Admission AMA.deepspringsapcom.replied to.stulotta.9 mo. ago.Yes, it is a lot. For good reason! Although it's a hot topic of debate and emendation, someone from a couple years ago said that isolation is "the gravity that allows us to dance." In other words, it focuses our attention on Deep Springs and the activities it gives us, so we can practice full dedication to a project larger than ourselves for when we get back to the real world..There is a religious and medical exemption to the policy. For example, there is a contingent that attends Mass in town every Sunday..Reply.reply.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.•.Deep Springs College Admission AMA.deepspringsapcom.replied to.Ok-Judgment-7128.9 mo. ago.Yes!

Will someone succeed at Deep Springs if they are consciously evil? Maybe. I sure hope they aren't successful if they are consciously hurting the world..I completely see where you're coming from with question #2. The answer is that we've had liberals, conservatives, anarchists, anti-vaxxers, fascists, Maoists, Marxists, everything. What makes one successful at Deep Springs is not the position you take but your ability to defend it eloquently and with an open-mindedness towards your fellow-community members who may not agree with you. In that way, Deep Springs is a paragon of political discourse on college campuses. I think this community is extremely tolerant of those who are willing to engage in a conversation or an argument, no matter where you come from. We even have a part of our bylaws that codifies everyone's right to "academic freedom of speech." It's a core part of the school, as it should be at every institution..Reply.reply.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege.r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to college list help and application advice, career guidance, and more..1.1M.Members.47.Online.•.Deep Springs College Admission AMA.deepspringsapcom.commented.9 mo. ago.Students have the option to get an Associate's degree if they wish to pursue it.

With the number of.undergraduates.restricted to 26, the college is one of the smallest institutions of higher education in the United States..[1].[a].Though it offers an.associate degree., most students transfer into a.four-year college.after completing their studies. Those enrolled pay.no tuition.and are given.room and board...Founded in 1917 as.Deep Springs Collegiate and Preparatory., it was originally a.men's college.backed by funding from.L. L. Nunn., a lawyer and businessman. Nunn envisioned an unorthodox form of education that combined academic rigor, manual labor, and self-governance. Located in a.geological depression., its campus is situated within a.cattle ranch.with the aim of providing a secluded environment away from urban life so undergraduates may focus on their studies and leadership ability. The college is primarily maintained and.self-governed.by students, becoming a.coeducational.institution in 2018..The college's alumni include.Rhodes.and.Truman.Scholars, two.Pulitzer Prize.recipients, three.MacArthur Fellows., and winners of an.Emmy.and.Lawrence Award., among multiple.academics.and.congressmen...History.[.edit.].L.L. Nunn., a graduate of.Harvard Law School., founded Deep Springs.Deep Springs was founded in 1917 by.L. L. Nunn., a.business magnate.who made a fortune building.alternating current.power plants.in the.Western United States.. Nunn's first projects—a hydroelectric plant in.Telluride, Colorado., and the.Olmsted Power Station.in.Provo, Utah.—served as the foundation for his inspiration to create a new type of educational institution..[3].As it became difficult to find enough engineers capable of living under rough conditions, he began schooling local men and pursued an interest in education..[4].Nunn eventually sold his industrial assets to fund the.Telluride Association., an educational trust based at.Cornell University., and the.Telluride House...[5].After becoming dissatisfied with the association's mission, he founded Deep Springs and helped in its administration until his death in 1925..[6].The establishment of Deep Springs was a reaction to what Nunn saw as a decline in academic standards in traditional American colleges..[7].His philosophy governing Deep Springs focused strictly around the pursuit of "academics, labor, and self-governance", something he dubbed the "three pillars" which supported the "whole man"..[8].The inclusion of manual labor in a college's educational program was unusual in 1917, but a number of so-called.manual labor colleges.had existed in the United States in the 19th century—including, at one time,.Oberlin College., which Nunn attended..[9].By the early 1860s, most had either closed or had abandoned their manual labor programs..[10].These pillars entailed students playing an active role in the administration of the college by laboring in the field and contributing to student meetings during committees, which Nunn believed was an effective method of producing "leaders for a democratic society"..[5].To this end, the.board of trustees., which Nunn established to preserve the college's traditions, contained one—later two—seats that were reserved for student trustees, who were elected by the.student body.and currently remain with full voice and voting rights..[11].Due to his correspondence with these early student bodies, Nunn decided the college would provide student housing and would not include a.tuition...[12].In the 1990s, the school's leadership debated transitioning the college to be.coeducational.. Whereas many women in the Telluride Association advocated for the change, a large portion of the school's alumni wished to keep its status as a men's college..[13].Though the board of Deep Springs voted against making any change in 1994, the college later accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan from Telluride under the condition that Deep Springs would begin admitting women by 2019..[14].In 2011, the college's trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees' action..[15].The challengers disputed the authority of the college's board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year..[16].[17].On April 13, 2017, the.California Court of Appeal.ruled that the college could admit women in.Hitz v. Hoekstra...[18].With the.Supreme Court of California.declining to hear an appeal,.[19].the board of trustees voted once again to admit women, with the first female students arriving in July 2018..[20].[21].Curriculum.[.edit.].Deep Springs students and staff moving cattle.Deep Springs involves students working on tasks in the nearby ranch including "cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, and fixing vehicles" with the.academic curriculum.dedicated wholly to the.liberal arts.such as.Ancient Greek., philosophy, political science, and literature..[1].Classes are taught by a long-term.faculty.—the.president.,.dean., and.chairs.of the.natural science.and.humanities.department—and a division of visiting professors and scholars which make up the short-term faculty, neither of which may hold.tenure...[22].Undergraduates work a minimum of 20 hours a week,.[23].rotating tasks while also studying for their classes..[12].Students attend classes during the morning and spend the afternoon working on the ranch..[24].Though the majority of learning is loosely regulated and done mainly through informal discussions, there are two required courses: freshman composition and public speaking..[25].After graduation, approximately two-thirds of the student body transfer to an.Ivy League.university or another similarly ranked institution,.[26].[27].with a substantial portion going on to attend.Cornell University.,.Brown University.or the.University of California, Berkeley...[12].[28].Self-governance is a critical part of the Deep Springs educational program. Students hold decision-making authority in determinations about admissions, curriculum, and faculty hiring. Every student serves on one of four standing committees during their time as a student: Applications (ApCom), Curriculum (CurCom), Communications (ComCom) or Review and Reinvitations (RCom). The Communications Committee (ComCom) was created in the early 1990s and charged with shaping the policies that define the college's relations with the world at large..[.citation needed.].Campus.[.edit.].View from main ranch to Deep Springs Valley.Deep Springs College is isolated within.Deep Springs Valley., a.geological depression.between the.White.and.Inyo.mountain ranges, with the nearest sizable town being.Bishop, California., and the closest.commercial airport.being in.Las Vegas...[23].With the college's campus consisting primarily of its 32,000-acre (13,000 ha) ranch,.[23].its physical isolation plays a central role in the educational experience. The college also contains a.bookstore.,.post office., and a.library., all maintained by students..[29].Partly due to Nunn's previous experience closing down a school in.Virginia.due to students deserting campus,.[23].the school's "isolation policy" forbids students from leaving the college's campus and prohibits the use of.alcohol...[7].Deep Springs used to have a direct telephone line crossing the White Mountains, but difficult maintenance made service unsustainable..[30].The line was replaced in the 1980s by a wireless radio link connecting to the Bishop.central office.. Because the radio signal is relayed using a repeater station high in the White Mountains, and because the first relay out of Deep Springs Valley does not have.line of sight., the system is subject to outages caused by high winds and inclement weather. Previously, the college's Internet connection was an unusually slow 14.4 kbit/s data channel.multiplexed.into the radio link. Not later than 2011, the college connected to the.internet by satellite...[31].Deep Springs has an.FM radio.-based.Voice over Internet Protocol.phone system,.[31].and.direct inward dialing...[32].A small.seismic station.exists behind the main campus, installed by the former.Soviet Union.as part of a bi-national underground nuclear test monitoring agreement..[33].Alumni.[.edit.].Despite the small number of admitted students, Deep Springs disproportionately produces members of academia with the majority of graduates going on to receive.doctorates.;.[34].these include multiple scholars, professors, authors, scientists, and.members of government.. The college's alumni have been awarded.Rhodes.and.Truman.Scholarships, three.MacArthur "genius grants"., two.Pulitzer Prizes., one.Emmy award., and one.E. O. Lawrence Award., among other honors. Prominent alumni include:.Robert B.

They meet in the Boarding House where they run into Sammy, who stayed up all night to work on his essay. After checking how much milk is in the fridge, Anousha and Townes depart for the dairy barn..When the two milkers return from the dairy barn at 6 am, seven gallons of milk in tow, Rory is already up preparing a breakfast of scrambled eggs, oatmeal, and biscuits and gravy. She cooks for the next hour and a half before serving to the twenty-odd students who made it to breakfast before their classes begin at 8 am..In poet Sarah Stickney’s course, Contemporary American Short Fiction, the class of eight discusses Toni Morrison’s “Recitatif.” Simultaneously, Linda Weiner leads her class on Euclid through Book One of.The Elements.. Class ends at 9:30, and at 9:45 a group of first-years depart for horsemanship with the Ranch Manager, Tim. Classes continue throughout the morning until lunch at 12:30 pm—today, burritos, and chili..During the afternoon, many students complete their labor for the day. The fence team drives down to the lake, eight miles across the valley, where they are repairing a fence around the Bog Mound Pasture. Gardeners Mo and Ryn spend the afternoon weeding, turning soil, and setting gopher traps. Schuyler brings bales of alfalfa to the heifers who are waiting to calve at the Lower Ranch. Dinner is at 6—a meal of hamburgers (made from Deep Springs beef), sweet potato fries, salad (from the college’s garden), and chocolate cake (in honor of the student baker’s birthday)..After dinner, students wash the dishes or try to fit some reading in before Public Speaking begins at 8. Seven students give speeches on topics ranging from an argument praising awkwardness to a personal narrative recounting one student’s childhood memories of Vietnam. Public Speaking concludes around 9, after which a handful of students cluster around the fireplace in the Boarding House, discussing their favorite speeches. As the moon rises over the Sierra, Anna and Michel go for a walk, Levi drafts his platform for the upcoming student trustee election, and Townes and Anousha head to sleep, ready to wake up and milk cows the next morning..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Case raises anew how institutions balance founders' intentions and the way society has evolved..By.Scott Jaschik.You have./.5.articles left..Sign up for a free account or log in..Sign Up, It’s FREE.Login.Deep Springs College had to reject all of its female applicants this week -- but that was no comment on their applications..Rather, a California judge granted an injunction to Deep Springs alumni who have sued to block the institution from admitting women. The judge ruled that under the terms of a trust that supports the college, the trustees lack the authority to admit women. That means that Deep Springs -- an unusual institution that enrolls only 26 students in a two-year program -- will remain all-male for at least another year..The college in 2011.announced plans to admit women this year..While officials plan to appeal the ruling, they say that there will not be finality on these issues during the current admissions cycle, so female applicants have been rejected, and male applicants have been told that they cannot expect a coeducational experience, at least next year. While the judge has issued his ruling, he has yet to release an opinion, so the judge's rationale is not yet clear..The judge's decision means that for the next academic year, there will be four men's undergraduate colleges (excluding seminaries) left in the United States: Deep Springs, Hampden-Sydney, Morehouse and Wabash Colleges. The Deep Springs case is the latest in a series of legal disputes over colleges that have come to the conclusion that they must change something significant that was established by institutional founders. Several legal experts predicted that Deep Springs will eventually be able to admit women, but that it may be in for a long fight to do so..Since its founding in 1917, the college has admitted very small classes of highly intelligent men, who take intense courses while managing both the college and its farm in an isolated spot in the High Desert of California. Students who complete the program are admitted as transfer students to some of the most competitive colleges in the country. All students receive a full scholarship (worth more than $50,000 a year). The decision to admit women followed years of requests by students to do so, and a series of decisions by the board not to do so..L.L. Nunn, the industrialist and educational thinker who founded Deep Springs, viewed its purpose as training male leaders, whom he dubbed "the few." Trustees said in 2011 that it was important to acknowledge today that women can and should be trained as leaders. The coeducation plan was to preserve the curricular and work requirements of the college, as well as its small size..A statement.from the college said: "We are disappointed that we cannot move ahead with coeducation this year, but remain confident about the final outcome of the ongoing litigation.".Joseph Liburt, a lawyer for the alumni seeking to block the enrollment of women (and himself an alumnus of Deep Springs), said that the case is very simple. The trust that established the college called for it to educate "young men," he said, while the board of the college "says that what this really means is young men and women.".When Nunn created the college, he meant men only, Liburt said. And it doesn't matter if society has since changed.."The trustees' foremost fiduciary duty is to carry out the terms of the trusts," Liburt said. "If they are unwilling to do so, they should resign.".He also said that news coverage has been "somewhat misleading" in describing the alumni legal action as being "against coeducation." Liburt noted that the vast majority of colleges and universities in the United States admit men and women, and said that the suit wouldn't change that. The case is about asking the court "to uphold the value of diversity in higher education," so that those male and female students who want single-sex education can find it..Michael A. Olivas, director of the University of Houston Institute of Higher Education Law and Governance, said that "Deep Springs is going to win at some point," and women will be admitted. In his book.The Law and Higher Education,.Olivas discussed several cases in which courts upheld the right of an institution to go against a founder's wishes. One of the most famous of such cases he includes was the battle by Rice University in the 1960s to admit nonwhite students, even though the university was founded to educate only white students.."Trustees not only have the power, but the duty to change" in certain circumstances, Olivas said. The laws vary to some degree from state to state, but generally assume that trustees will consider the wishes of the founders who created an institution, but also will consider other factors that may make the original terms unworkable. Truly taking fiduciary responsibility seriously, he said, means considering the future of a college, not just the circumstances that were present when it was created. Failing to see how the college and society have changed could in fact endanger a college's long-term survival, which is what trustees are charged with preserving, he said..Olivas noted that the trustees at Deep Springs didn't rush into coeducation, but considered it long and carefully. Further, they are preserving "the fundamentals" of the college. He said that in suits challenging a decision to go coed, plaintiffs have consistently lost, but that institutions take "a political hit" from alumni who are upset about the decision..The issue isn't just about single-sex status, Olivas said. He noted that in the current debate about whether Cooper Union should charge tuition, critics cite the principles that were used to set up the college. Olivas said that the trustees today are entitled to consider the long-term viability of that economic model, not just the original system of not charging tuition. He added that, many times, founding principles can't all be kept. For instance, one of Rice's arguments was that it could not achieve its founder's goal of being a top university while being a segregated one. Moving away from segregation advanced the larger goal, he said..David Neidorf, president of Deep Springs, said via e-mail that he too viewed the trustees' push to admit women as reflecting a commitment to L.L. Nunn's most important goals. "The shift to coeducation is required precisely for the sake of L.L. Nunn's founding intentions and educational mission," Neidorf said. "The nature of his intended mission obviously permits more than one conscientious interpretation -- otherwise there would be no dispute. But few people would in honesty conflate intention and mission with literal adherence to each particular practice in place without explanation nearly a century ago.".Neidorf added that "single-sex enrollment policy is neither an intention nor a mission; it's an educational device, used by professionals for the accomplishment of real and identifiable mission goals. The modern stakeholders who make possible the life of the college are entitled to see it evaluated as such -- and this is what the trustees have done. Those trustees would have failed in their duty to the college mission had they omitted that evaluation.".Debates about donor intent may be particularly intense with regard to colleges founded as single-sex institutions. Trustees of Wilson College, a women's institution, will be meeting this weekend to consider.a controversial plan.to admit men to the residential undergraduate program. But many colleges deal with donor intent questions in ways that don't capture public attention in the same way as a decision of a single-sex institution to become coeducational. Joseph R. Irvine, senior assistant general counsel for Ohio State University, said that colleges "take donor intent very seriously," but must sometimes seek changes in the way a gift or bequest was set up..He gave as an example a bequest of a house that the donor wanted a department to use for visiting faculty members. The house needed so much maintenance work that it would have required the department to spend money it didn't have before it could be used. Ohio State went to court (following a process set up in Ohio law) to sell the house and use the proceeds to support visiting faculty members at the department that the donor wanted to help. In these cases, he said, "you want to get as close as possible to a donor's intentions," but that doesn't mean never deviating from the way a donor set up a gift..Want articles like this sent.straight to your inbox.?.Subscribe to a Newsletter.Next Story.Government.Student Aid Policy.Rules Banning Transcript Holds, Expanding Overtime Now in Effect.A suite of new regulations governing higher education took effect Monday..Written By.Scott Jaschik.Share This Article.Found In.Traditional-Age.More from Traditional-Age.Admissions.Traditional-Age.Affirmative Action Ban’s Impact Is a ‘Black Box’.Bryan Cook wants to study how the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling is affecting diversity in higher ed..Business.Cost-Cutting.FAFSA Fiasco Forces Cuts at Small Colleges.Many small private colleges are surviving quarter to quarter, narrowly avoiding sweeping budget cuts..Students.Financial Aid.Financial Aid Timelines Sway Student Enrollment.A new report shows the importance of aid offers in college decisions—not just amount but also timeliness and clarity,.Advertisement.Sign up for Newsletters.Subscribe for free to.Inside Higher Ed’.s newsletters, featuring the latest news, opinion and great new careers in higher education — delivered to your inbox..View Newsletters.Advertisement.Campus.Resources for faculty and staff..Bridging the communication gap between administrators and faculty.Ways to seamlessly build breaks into your working day.THE podcast: cross-cultural communication in the international classroom.What does it mean for students to be AI-ready?.Emerging leaders, your universities need you.Want articles like this sent.straight to your inbox.?.Subscribe to a Newsletter.Company.Contact Us.About Us.Work with Us.History.Meet the Team.Advertise.Find a Job.Post a Job.Legal.Rights & Permissions.Privacy.Newsletter.Subscribe to a Newsletter.Sign up for Newsletters.Group.Daily News Update.Higher Education News, Opinion and Careers | Weekdays.Weekly News Update.Quick Summary of the Week's Higher Ed News | Fridays.Admissions Weekly Update.Admissions and Enrollment News, Opinion and Careers | Mondays.Diversity Weekly Update.Diversity News, Opinion and Career Advice | Tuesdays.Student Success.Student Success News, Ideas, Advice and Inspiration | Weekdays.Career Advice.Expert advice on how to succeed professionally | Thursdays.All Newsletters.Subscribe.Leave this field blank.Copyright © 2024 Inside Higher Ed All rights reserved. |.Website designed by nclud.Menu.Find a Job.Become a Member.Sign up for Newsletters.News.Faculty Issues.Curriculum.Teaching.Learning & Assessment.Diversity & Equity.Career Development.Tenure.Retirement.Labor & Unionization.Shared Governance.Academic Freedom.Research.Books & Publishing.Students.Academics.Retention.Financial Aid.Careers.Residential Life.Athletics.Free Speech.Physical & Mental Health.Safety.Diversity.Race & Ethnicity.Sex & Gender.Socioeconomics.Religion.Disability.Age.Admissions.Traditional-Age.Adult & Post-Traditional.Transfer.Graduate.Tech & Innovation.Teaching & Learning.Artificial Intelligence.Digital Publishing.Data Analytics.Libraries.Administrative Tech.Alternative Credentials.Business.Financial Health.Cost-Cutting.Revenue Strategies.Academic Programs.Physical Campuses.Mergers & Collaboration.Fundraising.Institutions.Research Universities.Regional Public Universities.Community Colleges.Private Nonprofit Colleges.Minority-Serving Institutions.Religious Colleges.Women's Colleges.Specialized Colleges.For-Profit Colleges.Governance.Executive Leadership.Trustees & Regents.State Oversight.Accreditation.Government.Politics & Elections.Supreme Court.Student Aid Policy.Science & Research Policy.State Policy.Colleges & Localities.Workplace.Employee Satisfaction.Remote & Flexible Work.Staff Issues.Global.Study Abroad.International Students in U.S..U.S. Colleges in the World.Opinion.Views.Intellectual Affairs.Career Advice.Seeking a Faculty Job.Advancing in the Faculty.Teaching.Seeking an Administrative Job.Advancing as an Administrator.Diversity.Blogs.Beyond Transfer.Call to Action.Confessions of a Community College Dean.Higher Ed Gamma.Higher Ed Policy.Just Explain It to Me!.Just Visiting.Law, Policy—and IT?.Leadership & StratEDgy.Leadership in Higher Education.Learning Innovation.Online: Trending Now.Resident Scholar.University of Venus.Letters.Hubs.Student Success.Student Voice.Academic Life.Health & Wellness.The College Experience.Life After College.Special.Podcasts.The Key.Academic Minute.Campus.The Pulse.Weekly Wisdom.Reports & Data.Events.Quick Takes.Solutions.Advertising & Marketing.Consulting Services.Data & Insights.Hiring & Jobs.Event Partnerships.Campus+.More.Post a Job.Campus.About.Contact Us.4./5.Articles remaining.this month..Sign up for a free account or log in..Sign Up, It’s FREE.Login.close

Nunn. After building power plants across North America, he devoted his wealth and influence to developing new forms of education. His two surviving educational projects, Deep Springs College and the.Telluride Association., are both imbued with his distinctive philosophy of education..Nunn’s career began in Telluride, Colorado, a small mining town where he operated a diverse set of businesses including several gold mines. Upon realizing the importance of electricity for mining, he used his assets to start what would become the Telluride Power Company. The venture built and acquired power plants across the western United States and in Canada and Mexico, and also pioneered methods for transmitting electricity over great distances..To staff his company, Nunn devised a unique in-house education system. Bright and hardworking young men were recruited to receive extensive training for free so that they could take leadership roles at the plants. Each student would begin by taking coursework in addition to their daily jobs. Then, successful students were given scholarships to continue their educations at elite universities..Education soon eclipsed business as Nunn’s primary concern. In 1909, he established the first Telluride House to provide room and board for his pupils earning degrees at Cornell University. The Telluride Association was formally constituted to administer the house. Nunn had discovered in the American west, where small towns were largely autonomous, that self-governance could foster individual virtues. Thus, he incorporated the idea of self-governance into the Telluride Association. Both the Telluride Association and the house at Cornell continue to operate today. The association has since expanded to include another Telluride House at University of Michigan, as well as two summer programs for high school students..His final project was to found an independent college that would prepare students for a “life of service to humanity” through a three-part program of liberal arts, student self-governance, and labor. After considering a number of possible locations, Nunn purchased a cattle ranch in eastern California that would become the campus of Deep Springs College. The college admitted its first class of twenty in 1917..Since Nunn’s death in 1925, the college has evolved while maintaining many tenets of his original vision. Alumni have gone on to become leaders in a number of fields, some receiving MacArthur Grants, Pulitzer Prizes, and Truman and Rhodes Scholarships. Today, Deep Springs is often cited as an example of the transformative experience that higher education can offer..Nunn’s model has been adopted or adapted by several other colleges, and may be considered as one of the primary influences for the “microcollege” movement. An.expanding list of colleges.that can be grouped into this movement is maintained by Thoreau College. Some are specifically inspired by L.L. Nunn’s vision, others are striking out in new directions. All share a human scale and a commitment to critically re-thinking and revitalizing higher education..The possibility of coeducation had been debated by the Deep Springs community since the 1960’s. The Deep Springs Board of Trustees voted in 2011 to begin admitting women but a legal challenge was brought by the two dissenting trustees. After more than five years of litigation, the California Supreme Court resolved the issue with a ruling in June, 2017, permitting the college to proceed with plans for admission of women as students. We have been very pleased to consider applications from all young people since the 2018 academic year..To view an archive of images from Deep Springs’ first century, go to.archive.deepsprings.edu..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Graduates of Deep Springs College have historically been successful in the transfer process to elite colleges and universities for several reasons:.Academic Rigor:.Deep Springs College offers a demanding academic program that includes small class sizes, close interactions with faculty members, and a strong emphasis on critical thinking and writing skills. This rigorous academic environment helps students develop the intellectual abilities and work ethic necessary to succeed at top-tier institutions..Personalized Attention:.Due to the small size of Deep Springs College (typically around 26 students per class), students receive personalized attention from faculty and staff. This individualized support can help students excel academically and navigate the transfer process effectively..Leadership and Community Engagement:.Deep Springs College places a strong emphasis on leadership development, community service, and collaborative decision-making. These experiences help students develop valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by elite colleges and universities..Strong Letters of Recommendation:.Given the close relationships that students form with faculty members at Deep Springs College, students are often able to secure strong letters of recommendation that highlight their academic abilities, personal qualities, and potential for success at a four-year institution..While Deep Springs College does not have formal connections to elite colleges, the institution's reputation for academic excellence and the accomplishments of its graduates may help students stand out in the transfer process. Admissions committees at top-tier institutions often value diversity and unique educational experiences, which Deep Springs College provides..It's important to note that success in the transfer process is not solely determined by institutional connections but also by the individual student's academic performance, extracurricular involvement, essays, recommendations, and fit with the institution. Deep Springs College's distinctive educational model and the qualities it fosters in its students can certainly contribute to their success in transferring to elite colleges and universities..Upvote.·.Kenneth Thomas.Studied at.Deep Springs College.·.Author has.4.1K.answers and.5M.answer views.·.3y.I essentially concur with John Brown’s assessment..Deep Springs attendees are somewhat self-selecting for the kind of person who is an ideal candidate at other US elites: self-motivated, generally in the top 1% of applicants to elites anyway, passionately interested in various pursuits, committed to lives of service to others, filled with ambitions often far beyond the average Ivy grind..As Roman Weil has just added, the DS admissions process—.nine essays and multi-day in-person interviews—.indeed makes what the elites do for selection look like a day in the park.

Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet..Upvote.·.999.410.999.121.99.18.Related questions.How hard is it to transfer between elite colleges?.What makes Deep Springs College so elite?.Is it possible to transfer into an elite university from community college?.What is the average number of colleges that Deep Springs College students transfer to?.Am I stupid to pick UC Berkeley over UChicago?

The programme lasts two years and there is no tuition fee. All students are expected to be heavily involved on the ranch. Students spend at least 20 hours a week working with the cattle or in the garden. Every seven weeks they are given a new work position. The guiding principles of Deep Springs College are effort, self-determination and community service. Work and learning at the college is designed to teach students both the possibilities and the limitations of democratic processes. The basic rules at the college include abstaining from alcohol and drugs. During the school year, students are not allowed to leave the valley where the ranch is located. Committees of students and teachers decide on the areas of application, study structure and content, evaluation and communication with the outside world. Positions to be filled, such as treasurer, fire chief and archivist, are also decided jointly. Every Friday evening there are discussions lasting several hours. Each year, 12 to 15 students are accepted. Between 6 and 15% of applicants are accepted, making Deep Springs one of the most selective colleges in the US. The college has only been accepting women since 2018..Goals.Goals.School practice that offers students the opportunity to be part of a community where they can learn, work, be in nature and understand the limits of democratic processes in a self-determined way.

Nur eine sehr kleine Minderheit (drei bis vier pro Jahrzehnt) der Studenten erwirbt nach den zwei Jahren einen Abschluss (.Associate Degree.), da fast alle Absolventen zu diesem Zeitpunkt an ein anderes College wechseln, um ihren.Bachelor.dort nach weiteren zwei Jahren abzuschließen. Viele besuchen nach Deep Springs angesehene Universitäten wie.Harvard University.,.University of Chicago.,.Yale University.oder.Brown University...Arbeit auf der Ranch.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Studenten und Mitarbeiter des College beim Viehtrieb.Deep Springs ist kein landwirtschaftliches College. Die Studenten sind jedoch stark in die Arbeit auf der Ranch eingebunden. Alle sieben Wochen werden den Studenten Arbeitspositionen zugeordnet, die vom Geschirrspülen über Beherbergung bis zur Geburtshilfe bei Rindern reichen. Die Studenten arbeiten mindestens 20 Stunden pro Woche. Jeder Student kann eine Liste seiner bevorzugten Positionen einreichen, über deren Vergabe wiederum ein anderer Student entscheidet..Die Ranch hat einen ökologisch bewirtschafteten Garten, der einen.Obstgarten., ein.Gewächshaus.,.Komposthaufen., einen Hühnerstall und Gemüsebeete umfasst..Die Rinderherde ist etwa 300 Tiere stark. Im Sommer grasen die Tiere in den.White Mountains.und werden von studentischen.Cowboys.betreut..Auf der Farm wird auf knapp 62.Hektar.Luzerne.angebaut. Die Ernte wird fast vollständig an die Rinderherde verfüttert. Der Anbau erfolgt ohne.Pflanzenschutzmittel.. Die Bewässerung stammt aus dem Wyman Creek und wird ergänzt durch.Brunnen...Selbstbestimmung.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Die Selbstbestimmung soll den Studenten die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen.demokratischer Prozesse.nahebringen. Es gibt jedoch einige Grundregeln. Dazu gehören der Verzicht auf.Alkohol.und andere.Drogen.und das Nichtverlassen des Tals während des Schuljahres. Es gibt mehrere Komitees, die sich aus Studenten und Lehrern zusammensetzen. Diese sind etwa für Bewerbungen, den Studienaufbau, die Evaluierung von Studenten und die Kommunikation mit der Außenwelt zuständig. Positionen wie Schatzmeister, Feuerwehrmeister oder Archivar werden durch Abstimmung besetzt. Jeden Freitagabend treffen sich alle Studenten und Lehrer zu mehrstündigen Diskussionen..Bekannte Absolventen.[.Bearbeiten.|.Quelltext bearbeiten.].Benjamin Kunkel., Schriftsteller.William A.

'''Deep Springs College''' (known simply as '''Deep Springs''' or '''DS''') is a [[Private college|private]] [[junior college]] in [[Deep Springs, California]]. With the number of [[undergraduates]] restricted to 26, the college is one of the smallest institutions of higher education in the United States.{{sfn|Staley|2019|p=49}}{{Efn|In L. Jackson Newell's 1982 assessment of Deep Springs College, he states that it "ranks second among the nation's institutions of higher learning with respect to the aptitude of the students it admits".<ref>Newell, 120.</ref>}} Though it offers an [[associate degree]], most students transfer into a [[four-year college]] after completing their studies. Those enrolled pay [[Free education|no tuition]] and are given [[room and board]].

Founded in 1917 as '''Deep Springs Collegiate and Preparatory''', it was originally a [[men's college]] backed by funding from [[L. L. Nunn]], a lawyer and businessman. Nunn envisioned an unorthodox form of education that combined academic rigor, manual labor, and self-governance. Located in a [[geological depression]], its campus is situated within a [[cattle ranch]] with the aim of providing a secluded environment away from urban life so undergraduates may focus on their studies and leadership ability. The college is primarily maintained and [[self-governed]] by students, becoming a [[coeducational]] institution in 2018.

The college's alumni include [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]] and [[Truman scholar|Truman]] Scholars, two [[Pulitzer Prize]] recipients, three [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]], and winners of an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award|Lawrence Award]], among multiple [[Professor|academics]] and [[congressmen]].

==History==
[[File:Lucien Lucius Nunn.jpg|thumb|199x199px|[[L. L. Nunn|L.L. Nunn]], a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]], founded Deep Springs  ]]
Deep Springs was founded in 1917 by [[L. L. Nunn]], a [[business magnate]] who made a fortune building [[alternating current]] [[Power station|power plants]] in the [[Western United States]]. Nunn's first projects—a hydroelectric plant in [[Telluride, Colorado]], and the [[Olmsted Station Powerhouse|Olmsted Power Station]] in [[Provo, Utah]]—served as the foundation for his inspiration to create a new type of educational institution.{{sfn|Bailey|1933|p=28}} As it became difficult to find enough engineers capable of living under rough conditions, he began schooling local men and pursued an interest in education.{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|p=13}} Nunn eventually sold his industrial assets to fund the [[Telluride Association]], an educational trust based at [[Cornell University]], and the [[Telluride House]].{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|p=14}} After becoming dissatisfied with the association's mission, he founded Deep Springs and helped in its administration until his death in 1925.{{sfn|Bailey|1933|p=68}}

The establishment of Deep Springs was a reaction to what Nunn saw as a decline in academic standards in traditional American colleges.{{sfn|Newell|1982|p=122}} His philosophy governing Deep Springs focused strictly around the pursuit of "academics, labor, and self-governance", something he dubbed the "three pillars" which supported the "whole man".{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|pp=14-15}} The inclusion of manual labor in a college's educational program was unusual in 1917, but a number of so-called [[manual labor college]]s had existed in the United States in the 19th century—including, at one time, [[Oberlin College]], which Nunn attended.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Blodgett |first=Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Blodgett |title=Oberlin History. Essays and Impressions |publisher=[[Kent State University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=0873388879 |location=[[Kent, Ohio]] |page=12 |chapter=Myth and Reality in Oberlin History}}</ref> By the early 1860s, most had either closed or had abandoned their manual labor programs.{{sfn|Lull|1914|p=387}}

These pillars entailed students playing an active role in the administration of the college by laboring in the field and contributing to student meetings during committees, which Nunn believed was an effective method of producing "leaders for a democratic society".{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|p=14}} To this end, the [[Board of Trustees|board of trustees]], which Nunn established to preserve the college's traditions, contained one—later two—seats that were reserved for student trustees, who were elected by the [[student body]] and currently remain with full voice and voting rights.{{sfn|Newell|Reynolds|Marsh|Green|1993|p=23}} Due to his correspondence with these early student bodies, Nunn decided the college would provide student housing and would not include a [[Tuition payments|tuition]].{{sfn|Newell|Reynolds|Marsh|Green|1993|p=24}}

In the 1990s, the school's leadership debated transitioning the college to be [[coeducation]]al. Whereas many women in the Telluride Association advocated for the change, a large portion of the school's alumni wished to keep its status as a men's college.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|p=214}} Though the board of Deep Springs voted against making any change in 1994, the college later accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan from Telluride under the condition that Deep Springs would begin admitting women by 2019.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Goodyear |first=Dana |date=August 28, 2006 |title=The Searchers: The fate of progressive education at Deep Springs College |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/the-searchers-dana-goodyear |access-date=October 1, 2019 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> In 2011, the college's trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees' action.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |date=September 19, 2011 |title=Elite, All-Male University of the Wild West To Go Coed |url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/deep-springs/ |access-date=June 13, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The challengers disputed the authority of the college's board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Deep Springs College |url=http://www.deepsprings.edu/news%20and%20events/coeducation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717000520/http://www.deepsprings.edu/news%20and%20events/coeducation |archive-date=July 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Jaschik |first=Scott |date=January 11, 2012 |title=Women Blocked at Deep Springs |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/01/11/judge-blocks-deep-springs-college-admitting-women |access-date=January 12, 2012 |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]}}</ref> On April 13, 2017, the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] ruled that the college could admit women in ''Hitz v.

==Curriculum <!-- Work in Progress, will reorganize with relevant info! -->==
[[File:DeepSpringsCattleDrive.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=1.5|Deep Springs students and staff moving cattle]]Deep Springs involves students working on tasks in the nearby ranch including "cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, and fixing vehicles" with the [[Curriculum|academic curriculum]] dedicated wholly to the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] such as [[Ancient Greek]], philosophy, political science, and literature.{{sfn|Staley|2019|p=49}} Classes are taught by a long-term [[Faculty (division)|faculty]]—the [[University President|president]], [[Dean (education)|dean]], and [[Chair (academic department)|chairs]] of the [[natural science]] and [[humanities]] department—and a division of visiting professors and scholars which make up the short-term faculty, neither of which may hold [[tenure]].{{sfn|Staley|2019|pp=49-50}} Undergraduates work a minimum of 20 hours a week,{{sfn|JBHE|2004|p=43}} rotating tasks while also studying for their classes.{{sfn|Newell|Reynolds|Marsh|Green|1993|p=24}}

Students attend classes during the morning and spend the afternoon working on the ranch.{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|p=16}} Though the majority of learning is loosely regulated and done mainly through informal discussions, there are two required courses: freshman composition and public speaking.{{sfn|Anderson|Diehl|2004|p=17}} After graduation, approximately two-thirds of the student body transfer to an [[Ivy League]] university or another similarly ranked institution,{{sfn|Newell|Reynolds|Marsh|Green|1993|p=26}}{{sfn|Newell|1982|p=124}} with a substantial portion going on to attend [[Cornell University]], [[Brown University]] or the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfn|Newell|Reynolds|Marsh|Green|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Fleming|2009|p=209}} 

Self-governance is a critical part of the Deep Springs educational program. Students hold decision-making authority in determinations about admissions, curriculum, and faculty hiring. Every student serves on one of four standing committees during their time as a student: Applications (ApCom), Curriculum (CurCom), Communications (ComCom) or Review and Reinvitations (RCom). The Communications Committee (ComCom) was created in the early 1990s and charged with shaping the policies that define the college's relations with the world at large.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

==Campus==
[[Image:Falltreeofwoe2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|View from main ranch to Deep Springs Valley]]
Deep Springs College is isolated within [[Deep Springs Valley]], a [[Depression (geology)|geological depression]] between the [[White Mountains (California)|White]] and [[Inyo Mountains|Inyo]] mountain ranges, with the nearest sizable town being [[Bishop, California]], and the closest [[commercial airport]] being in [[Las Vegas]].{{sfn|JBHE|2004|p=43}} With the college's campus consisting primarily of its {{convert|32,000|acre|adj=on}} ranch,{{sfn|JBHE|2004|p=43}} its physical isolation plays a central role in the educational experience. The college also contains a [[bookstore]], [[post office]], and a [[library]], all maintained by students.{{sfn|Newell|1982|p=123}} Partly due to Nunn's previous experience closing down a school in [[Virginia]] due to students deserting campus,{{sfn|JBHE|2004|p=43}} the school's "isolation policy" forbids students from leaving the college's campus and prohibits the use of [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]].{{sfn|Newell|1982|p=122}}

Deep Springs used to have a direct telephone line crossing the White Mountains, but difficult maintenance made service unsustainable.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Seastrom |first=Robert E. |year=1989 |title=The inward operator |url=http://yarchive.net/phone/inward_operator.html |website=Telecom Digest (listserv) |quote=To contact us, call your long distance carrier and ask for Deep Springs Toll Station #2." A toll station was a [[non-dialable point]] – effectively, a single line manual exchange with no local calling area and one lone subscriber. The only way to call in was to have a long-distance operator ring the inward operator in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] (routing code [[area code 619|619]]+058+121) who would then put the call through manually. 'Deep Springs Toll Station #2.' was the published number until 1987; an attempt to call this in 1989 reported 'not in service'.}}</ref> The line was replaced in the 1980s by a wireless radio link connecting to the Bishop [[Telephone exchange|central office]]. Because the radio signal is relayed using a repeater station high in the White Mountains, and because the first relay out of Deep Springs Valley does not have [[line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], the system is subject to outages caused by high winds and inclement weather. Previously, the college's Internet connection was an unusually slow 14.4&nbsp;kbit/s data channel [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] into the radio link. Not later than 2011, the college connected to the [[Satellite Internet access|internet by satellite]].<ref name="Evaluation">{{Cite report |url=https://www.deepsprings.edu/wp-content/uploads/Deep-Springs-College-2011-Comprehensive-Evaluation-Visit-Report.pdf |title=Deep Springs College Accreditation Team Evaluation Report |date=March 21-24, 2011}}</ref> Deep Springs has an [[FM radio]]-based [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] phone system,<ref name="Evaluation" /> and [[direct inward dialing]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Employment FAQ |url=https://www.deepsprings.edu/employment/faqs/ |access-date=18 July 2022 |website=Deep Springs College}}</ref>

A small [[seismic station]] exists behind the main campus, installed by the former [[Soviet Union]] as part of a bi-national underground nuclear test monitoring agreement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Monitoring |url=http://www.seismo.unr.edu/Monitoring |access-date=18 July 2022 |website=Nevada Seismological Lab |quote=37.37,-117.97 Deep Springs, California w84gm}}</ref>

==Alumni==

Despite the small number of admitted students, Deep Springs disproportionately produces members of academia with the majority of graduates going on to receive [[doctorate]]s;{{sfn|Tierney|1993|p=35}} these include multiple scholars, professors, authors, scientists, and [[Member of Congress|members of government]]. The college's alumni have been awarded [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]] and [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] Scholarships, three [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "genius grants"]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, one [[Emmy award]], and one [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award|E.&nbsp;O. Lawrence Award]], among other honors. Prominent alumni include:

Classes usually have between four and twelve students. In most courses, the majority of class time is spent in seminar-style discussions. (Other forms of class structure, including those based in the lab, studio or field, also regularly appear within the curriculum.) There are no majors or concentrations, and students are encouraged to explore a variety of topics in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing course from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. Classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..Curriculum structure.Curriculum.During the regular academic year, students take two or three full courses at a time. There are typically nine courses offered. The Curriculum Committee maintains a balance of course offerings within the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Courses range from The Special Theory of Relativity to Art and Politics in Twentieth-Century China. While the curriculum includes introductory courses from the major disciplines, it is common for classroom discourse at Deep Springs to cover material reserved for upper-division or graduate seminars elsewhere. In addition, students commonly pursue independent or directed studies, with permission from the Curriculum Committee. There are only three required courses at Deep Springs, each outlined below..The facilities and resources at students’ disposal include a fully equipped science lab, a library with over 30,000 volumes, a museum and archive with rich historical material from Deep Springs and the local area, an art studio, a music studio and collection of musical instruments including a Steinway grand piano, a darkroom, and more..Required Courses.Summer Seminar.The Summer Seminar is the introduction to Deep Springs academics for each incoming class. Often taught by an interdisciplinary team of professors, the course focuses on issues of ethics and governance. Students read and discuss diverse works of literature, philosophy, and social sciences..Writing.Although writing-intensive courses vary in their specifics from year to year, students learn how to write well and how to offer constructive criticism to others. Particular attention is paid to crafting cogent arguments and giving due consideration of the audience of a written piece..Public Speaking.All students take Public Speaking throughout their time at Deep Springs. The campus community meets each week to listen to speakers practice their rhetorical skills. Afterward, the speakers meet to receive feedback on their performance from peers and professors. Each student gives two graded speeches per semester..Elective Courses.Deep Springs College operates year-round. See the.Academic Calendar.for an example of a typical academic year. In addition to the required courses, the balance of the two to three full courses taken by a student in any given term are elected by the student and approved by the Curriculum Committee. Short descriptions of classes offered during the most recent six academic years can be found in the Deep Springs College.Course Catalog (2019-2024)...Faculty.Faculty Overview.At Deep Springs, the student to faculty ratio is usually about 5:1. In addition to the President and the Dean, the college generally employs three long-term faculty: the Robert Aird Chair of Humanities, the Julian Steward Chair of Social Sciences, and the Herbert Reich Chair of Natural Science. The three long-term chairs have two-year appointments renewable up to six years. There is no tenure. Searches for the Robert Aird Chair of Humanities and the Julian Steward Chair of Social Sciences will open in Fall 2024..Each academic term, one to three short-term professors visit to increase the breadth of our curriculum.

Alla elever är idag manliga, men skolans styrelse har tagit beslut om ta emot kvinniga elever från 2013. Det ligger i en mindre högplatådal öster om.Sierra Nevada.i östra Kalifornien mot gränsen till.Nevada., 40 km från närmaste tätort och 72 km från närmaste stad,.Bishop.i Kalifornien..Pedagogiken på Deep Springs College bygger på tre element: undervisning i filosofi och naturvetenskapliga ämnen, fysiskt arbete och elevsjälvbestämmande i utbildningsfrågor. Det liknar i vissa avseenden ett arbetskollektiv. Utöver studietid lägger eleverna ner minst 20 timmar per vecka på arbete på den egna jordbruksfastigheten på 1 700 hektar med odling av bland annat.alfalfa., får- och boskapsskötsel samt mejeri..Utbildning samt kost och logi är gratis. Deep Springs College grundades 1917 av.Lucien Lucius Nunn.(1853-1925), en entreprenör från.Telluride.i.Colorado., som tjänade en förmögenhet på att bygga kraftverk baserade på växelström i västra USA. Kraftverksbyggena krävde välutbildade ingenjörer som kunde leva under hårda villkor i obygder. Nunn hade svårigheter att rekrytera sådana från östkusten och startade därför utbildning i egen regi av ungdomar från området. Han intresserade sig mer och mer för utbildning, sålde sina industriella tillgångar och investerade dem i två skolor. Först grundade han 1911 Telluride Association, en utbildningsstiftelse vid.Cornell University.. Sedan han tyckt sig förstå att den fysiska miljön på Cornell underminerade hans pedagogiska idéer, köpte han 1917 den isolerade Deep Springs Ranch och grundade där Deep Springs College. Han medverkade i dess drift fram till sin död 1925..Källor.[.redigera.|.redigera wikitext.].Po Tidholm:.Första svensken på elitskolan.i Dagens Nyheter söndag 29 januari, sidorna 16-23.Noter.[.redigera.|.redigera wikitext.].Externa länkar.[.redigera.|.redigera wikitext.].Deep Springs Colleges webbplats.Deep Roots; An Idea Preserved, film om Deep Springs College, sju minuter.Comboy Scholars.i Vanity Fair juni 2004.View from main ranch to Deep Springs Valley.Hämtad från ”.https://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deep_Springs_College&oldid=53482168.”.Kategorier.:.Skolor i USA.Utbildning i Kalifornien.Sidan redigerades senast den 8 juli 2023 kl. 20.39..Wikipedias text är tillgänglig under licensen.Creative Commons Erkännande-dela-lika 4.0 Unported..

Wait a moment and try again..Try again.Skip to content.Skip to search.Sign In.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.3 Answers.Best.Ethan Reichsman.Deep Springs College 2016, Harvard College 2019.·.8y.Short answer: there is none..Longer answer, there really isn't.

Because the school is so small, it's hard to make sweeping generalizations about the student body. We have students from all over the world, of many different ethnicities and backgrounds. Deep Springs struggled with diversity for many years, in large part because people would principally hear about the school through word of mouth, which traveled in fairly homogenous circles (white, affluent, well–educated). However, the current makeup of the student body is as diverse as it's ever been, and efforts are being made to keep up that trend..As far as what the college looks for in an applicant, it's not too different from a standard liberal arts college. Intellectual curiosity, hard work, and willingness to be a part of such a strange and close–knit community are basic factors. Really, wanting to go to Deep Springs specifically is also important, because if you don't have a good idea of why you want to come to this place, and what you'll get out of it, it can very easily be a hard place to live..Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6.

You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill.

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools.. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to.comcom@deepsprings.edu...To make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page.here...Academics.Like the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Does it have connections to these elite colleges?.Kenneth Thomas.Studied at.Deep Springs College.·.Author has.4.1K.answers and.5M.answer views.·.3y.·.I essentially concur with John Brown’s assessment..Deep Springs attendees are somewhat self-selecting for the kind of person who is an ideal candidate at other US elites: self-motivated, generally in the top 1% of applicants to elites anyway, passionately interested in various pursuits, committed to lives of service to others, filled with ambitions often far beyond the average Ivy grind..As Roman Weil has just added, the DS admissions process—.nine essays and multi-day in-person interviews—.indeed makes what the elites do for selection look like a day in the park. My Harvard and Yale interviewers were collegial and friendly, a sort of “we know you probably got in so here’s why you should choose my alma mater over the other options you will have.”.The DS classes above me were nice over dinner, but in the interviews they.grilled me..Sort of like high school debate, but for hours. Everyone in the room had read what I had written closely, in-depth— and came ready to engage, discuss and challenge. If there was something weak, they were going to ask about it..To put this in some perspective, for a Quora audience that no doubt has heard again and again how hard it is to get into the elites, “they have thousands of qualified applicants.yadda yadda.:.”.most of the Deep Springers I knew would be in the top 50 applicants for Harvard or Yale in any year; people so attractive to the institutions that they are practically guaranteed admission, often recruited with a zeal beyond the athletics team, and generally showered with special scholarships and programs to encourage attendance..Or, to make it personal for those of you who were watching Noah Feldman in Congressional hearings on TV recently— I remember Noah commenting one afternoon, that he was applying to Yale, as unappealing as being exiled to New Haven might be for him,.because if he only applied to Harvard he was afraid Bill Fitzsimmons would reject him to teach him a lesson..Noah was accepted to both, of course— as were the other five people who were a part of that conversation. Roughly speaking, the kind of people who make it to DS, are Noah Feldman type people, and Harvard doesn’t have thousands of those to choose from— it has dozens per year, at most..702 views.·.View upvotes.·.Answer requested by.Nicholas.1 of 4 answers.Comments.View.3.other answers to this question.About the Author.Kenneth Thomas.Former CTO.1998–2001.Studied at.Deep Springs College.Lives in.Earth.5.1M content views.57.3K this month.Active in 3 Spaces.Knows.French.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

Ruiz.September 19, 2011 6:38 pm.September 19, 2011 6:38 pm.Deep Springs College., the historically all-male two-year institution located on a cattle ranch in California, voted on Saturday that it would admit women..The school’s philosophy is unique, blending manual labor — scrubbing pots, slaughtering cows, baling hay — with one or two 90-minute classes a day. Its 26 students attend tuition-free and most go
                                        on to complete four-year degrees at highly competitive universities like.Oxford.and.Yale.. The college’s formula has changed little since
                                        its founding in 1917 — until now..David Neidorf, president of the college, emphasized in an interview that the decision to admit women to Deep Springs was not one motivated by financial or legal pressures, and that enrollment size would remain fixed..What does this decision mean for potential applicants, both female and male?.Deep Springs’s acceptance rate hovers around 8 percent. Significantly expanding the potential applicant pool — to include both men and women — while keeping constant the supply of seats at the college
                                        will assuredly make fierce competition for admission even fiercer..The college’s decision, though, is not immediately effective..“Sometime over the next six months, we’ll establish what date we will begin to accept applications from women — the summer of 2013 at the earliest,” Mr. Neidorf said. “People applying
                                        to the college this fall will still be considered an all-male class.”.Last week’s vote on the matter of admitting women to Deep Springs was not the first time the subject was taken up. The college had voted against coeducation in 1994. As The New Yorker.reported.in 2006:.The controversial subject has created a fissure in the school’s relationship with the Telluride Association [founded by the same man who founded Deep Springs College], where women have been members for 45
                                            years. The Association lent the college $1.8 million in 1988 to renovate its main building with the catch that if it hasn’t changed its all-male policy by 2019 it will have to start repaying the loan.
                                            Some fear that adding women to the mix might upset the college’s already delicate balance..Have readers of.The Choice.had experience applying to or attending a single-sex institution recently gone coeducational? Let us know in the.comment box...Share.Comments are no longer being accepted..Kiron.September 20, 2011.·.12:00 pm.A very bad idea. The begining of the fall of its high priniciples, which I presume it has. They should look into surveys, studies done on the success rate of all male and all female schools. Another one of the few
                                            bastions of high education fall. Men and women are different and hence educated differently. Men’s schools produce real men and gentleman. Women’s schools produce secure women, not in constant
                                            need of male affirmation -more well-balanced, who treat and appreciate other women for their virtues, less caty and competitive and jealous of each other..And I am a woman..Joshua Kim.September 20, 2011.·.12:39 pm.I was at Deep Springs between 1995 and 1997. We had 3 female students visiting from Cornell during my first year there. I didn’t quite get along with any of them. In fact, you could say that I disliked them
                                            all. Then and now, however, I have deep respect and admiration for their intellect..Sexual tension has always been a source of anxiety for Deep Springers. Co-ed or not, it will always be. So I’m glad that the school decided to no longer limit its applicant pool to only 1/2 of the population.
                                            Kudos to President Neidorf and Bret L..DCM.September 21, 2011.·.5:51 am.Another college is doomed..A DS alum.September 24, 2011.·.6:50 pm.The vote on co-ed came through the long efforts of David Hitz, a DS alum, founder of NetApp and current chairman of the college’s board of trustees. In the 1990s, the board opposed going co-ed despite broad
                                            student body support, souring relations between the two groups and calling into question the school’s self-governance, which is one of its fundamental principles..Mr. Hitz and his fellow directors have removed the chief obstacle to co-education. That said, it’s not clear whether the majority of the alumni, or the present student body, are behind them. An ambivalent
                                            majority has triumphed over an ambivalent minority..In any case, they’re taking small utopian experiment in direct democracy and performing an additional experiment upon it. That additional experiment, however, is pretty much in line with colleges everywhere
                                            else in the country..DS will no longer differentiate itself from other schools and most of society by being single-sex. What the college gains in accepting female applicants, American higher education will lose in institutional diversity,
                                            however anachronistic the institution may be..A. Jane Johnston.February 12, 2013.·.12:02 pm.I am a woman, and I attended a summer program run by the Telluride Association in 1989 at Deep Springs. The students were a mix of Telluride young people (between our junior and senior years of high school) and
                                            Deep Springs students..I was crushed by the end of the summer that I could not attend Deep Springs for college, and at that point in my life would have preferred going there to Yale, where I went instead. I filled out an application (ten
                                            essays back then) as a political gesture..I continued to ponder the Deep Springs situation while at Yale, and made a video called cult/culture that was critical of some of the shortcomings of the college and its culture..To me, the most compelling coed argument is that Deep Springs is supposed to educate leaders for lives of service, but it is hindered from doing so because our world is sexist and discriminatory against women. These
                                            young boys who spend two years in splendid isolation from their female colleagues end up in other colleges where they might have trouble adjusting to the fact that they have female peers just as brainy and special

The college is known for its small size, with a student body of fewer than 30 students, and its remote location in the high desert of California..Deep Springs College offers a two-year liberal arts education with a strong focus on academics, labor, and self-governance. Students are actively involved in the operation of the college, including tasks such as farming, cooking, and maintenance work in addition to their academic studies. This hands-on approach to education is one of the key aspects that set Deep Springs apart from more traditional colleges and universities..The college has a highly selective admissions process and a strong emphasis on intellectual rigor, critical thinking, and community engagement. Graduates of Deep Springs often go on to pursue further education at top universities or make significant contributions in various fields..While Deep Springs College may not be the right fit for everyone due to its unique structure and remote location, it is considered by many to be a transformative and enriching educational experience for those who thrive in its challenging and unconventional environment. It has garnered a reputation for fostering a strong sense of community, intellectual curiosity, and personal growth among its students..Ultimately, whether Deep Springs College is as unparalleled as the media reports may depend on individual perspectives and priorities in education.

Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill.

If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better?

The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5.

They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school".

Great leaders in all ages have sought the desert and heard its voice. You can hear it if you listen, but you cannot hear it while in the midst of uproar and strife for material things. ‘Gentlemen, for what came ye into the wilderness?’ Not for conventional scholastic training; not for ranch life; not to become proficient in commercial or professional pursuits for personal gain. You came to prepare for a life of service, with the understanding that superior ability and generous purpose would be expected of you.”.Deep Springs Founder L.L. Nunn, 1923.Since its founding in 1917, Deep Springs has been singularly motivated by its mission to “prepare young people for a life of service to humanity,” which can be seen throughout the day-to-day operation of the College..By exposing students to an array of challenging responsibilities, the College offers them the opportunity for very real success and failure. In the classroom, at work in the labor program, or in committee and SB meetings, student responsibilities are concrete and have a direct impact on the everyday life of the College community. The ground rules are intended to keep students focused on the educational work at hand, not escaping it through outside distractions. In keeping with the spirit of self-governance, these limitations are enforced by the Student Body itself..However, the most precise description of Deep Springs’ purpose comes directly from the mission statement itself, provided below in full..The mission of Deep Springs College is to prepare young people for a life of service to humanity. Leadership and enlightened service are the aims of Deep Springs, which fulfills its educational mission by bringing students into intense contact with nature, work, and ideas..Deep Springs’ challenging and comprehensive educational program is designed for a few of the most promising students entering college each year. No tuition or fees are levied, but strenuous effort, self-governance, and selfless service to the community are expected of everyone..The college takes sound principles of teaching and learning to their practical limits. Based on a cattle ranch in an isolated desert-mountain valley, the college enables its students to experience and take year-round responsibility for a largely self-sustaining community, ranch, and farm, while requiring them to engage in a two-year liberal arts honors program..The program provides the curriculum necessary to obtain an Associate of Arts degree. Learning is pursued to solve real problems, both practical and social, for the joy of intellectual understanding and humane action..Those who are educated at Deep Springs incur a lifelong obligation to improve the human condition..Adopted 1998, revised 2016.Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools.. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to.comcom@deepsprings.edu...To make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page.here...Academics.Like the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

If your question is not listed here, feel free to call the main office at 760-872-2000, ext. 33, or email the.Office Manager or Director of Operations...Does Deep Springs have internet access?.A wireless network is available in staff/faculty homes and offices, but due to the College’s remote location, internet access can be slow by modern standards and is occasionally unreliable. There is usually no problem with email, web browsing, and audio-only services like Skype or Spotify. However, bandwidth-heavy activities such as downloading and uploading large files, streaming video, or using cloud backup services may not always be possible from campus. Employees may also purchase private satellite TV or internet services if they want a private backup connection..What are employee accommodations like?.Employees are provided with housing on the Deep Springs campus. Residence on campus is usually a requirement of employment. The college has several employee residences, which are assigned based on employees’ needs and length of their stay. Accommodations range from studio-type residences to duplexes and full houses with multiple bedrooms and full kitchens. Residences are all located within 2 miles of the main campus..What are meals like? Can you accommodate special dietary needs?.Community members are welcome to eat at the boardinghouse, which offers three meals per weekday and two each on Sunday and Saturday. The College produces much of its own dairy, as well as substantial quantities of beef, chicken, pork and eggs. In the summer months, the garden turns out a cornucopia of fresh fruits and vegetables. Meals are lively social occasions, full of laughter and conversation. Occasionally, community members will conspire to cook a feast of their own. A vegetarian option is offered for most meals. Special dietary needs are handled on a case-by-case basis..What services & amenities are available nearby (medical care, shopping, restaurants, etc.)?.The town of.Bishop, CA.is located about 40 miles away, over a 7,500 foot pass. Bishop has a regional hospital and multiple medical care providers, coffee shops, grocery stores, a book store, a movie theater, multiple restaurants and several city parks. There are many nearby natural attractions including Palisade Glacier, Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, Alabama Hills, Mono Lake, Death Valley National Park, Yosemite National Park, Devil’s Postpile National Monument, and the Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort. Numerous trailheads leading into the eastern Sierra are within 1 to 2 hours’ drive from the college..What’s the nearest airport to Deep Springs? Is public transportation to the College available?.The nearest major airport is McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas (LAS), about a 4 hour drive away. The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is a 5-6 hour drive, depending on traffic, and the Reno-Tahoe airport (RNO) is about 4.5 hours. The San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is an 8 hour drive..Additionally, the town of Bishop has a small airport (BIH), also known as the Eastern Sierra Regional Airport. The airport is open seasonally and mostly serves skiers and climbers. When it is open, it offers daily connecting flights to a few hubs..There is no public transportation directly to the college, but a.bus service.runs along highway 395 from Lancaster, CA to Reno, NV, which allows transportation from the Reno or Los Angeles airports to Bishop, CA..What educational opportunities are available for my children at Deep Springs?.Deep Springs is in the Bishop Unified School District. Bishop has K-12 school system and is an hour drive from campus. Employees may also choose to homeschool their children, or participate in an online schooling programs..Although Deep Springs’ students may offer to tutor children in some subjects, this is not expected of students, and student tutoring should not be treated as a substitute for accredited schooling..Is childcare available?.Unfortunately, there is no childcare available at Deep Springs. Families may make private arrangements with other community members, but there is no guarantee that care will be available. Several childcare and preschool programs are available in Bishop. The college may provide room and board for additional caregivers, depending on housing availability..Do the “ground rules” apply to me?.The Student Body historically maintains two ground rules for its members during academic session: a prohibition against use of drugs or alcohol, and the “isolation policy” which prohibits students from leaving the valley except for emergencies, religious observance, or college business..The isolation policy does not apply to college employees, but all community members share the benefits of the campus’s isolated location. Bishop, CA, the nearest town with a selection of stores and restaurants, is forty miles away over a mountain pass. This isolation emphasizes the stark, tranquil beauty of the landscape..The student prohibition against alcohol does not apply to employees. However, out of respect for the students, not to mention applicable state and federal law, employees are prohibited from drinking with or serving alcohol to students, regardless of their age. Employees are expected to follow all applicable state and federal laws regarding the use of alcohol and drugs..What is my relationship to the.Labor Pillar.?.Faculty:.Faculty members are encouraged, but not obligated, to participate in labor at the College. Students spend at least twenty hours each week laboring around the campus, and faculty who educate themselves in the labor aspect of students’ lives often find the work to be illuminating and rewarding. Students generally welcome faculty involvement..Staff:.For staff members, participating in the labor pillar is an integral part of the job. Staff members oversee student labor in their area of expertise and are expected to provide constructive feedback where applicable. For example, the cook oversees and coordinates student cooks and the student kitchen cleaning crew; the gardener directs student labor in the garden; the farm manager directs students as they irrigate, maintain, and harvest the college’s alfalfa fields, etc. Staff work closely with the student Labor Commissioner to ensure the essential operations of the college are done well and safely..How will my application be reviewed?.Faculty applications are reviewed by the Curriculum Committee, one of the four standing committees composed of students and faculty members. Staff applications are reviewed by an ad-hoc committee of students and community members. The relevant committee reviews applications, conducts phone interviews and, for long-term positions, invites finalists to the college for an in-person interview. After deliberation, the committee makes a hiring recommendation to the Director of Operations (for Staff) or Academic Dean (for Faculty) and the college President. As is the case with student applicants, an important quality in all hires is an applicant’s “fit” with the college, and an understanding of and respect for its methods and goals..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

The school, founded by L.L. Nunn in 1917 on the three pillars of labor, self-governance, and academics, aims to prepare its students for lives of service to humanity..Why are the essay questions on the application so weird?.It is all too easy to fall into traditional modes of self-presentation when applying to colleges. But since Deep Springs is unusual, it is hard to tell from “usual” essays how well a student might fare here. This means our essay questions should bring you to a stop for an hour or two..Please don’t be discouraged if you’re not sure at first what to say. We have tried to ask questions about things you haven’t already studied, and to craft questions that cannot be answered without taking some time to think about them first. We hope that our applicants will enjoy this opportunity..Can I visit Deep Springs?.Deep Springs does not have an admissions staff to welcome visitors or provide tours. We try to limit the number of campus visits in order to ensure the best possible atmosphere for our focus on education..It’s not that we are anti-social; it’s simply that our community is very small, and the students and staff are heavily scheduled with labor and academics. Because of this, there is no one with the free time to show visitors around and talk to them about the College. If we encouraged the kind of prospective applicant visits typical of other colleges, students would risk falling behind on labor and academic responsibilities, and, worse, treating visitors rudely by mistake..That said, we don’t expect students to enroll without visiting. We require a visit from most applicants once they have reached the second round of our applications process. That way we can consolidate the visiting times and provide proper attention to the visiting applicants. Travel support is available for applicants who need it..Is a visit required as part of the second-round application? What if I can’t afford it?.If you are admitted to the second round of our application process, you can apply for financial support for travel expenses within the United States. (If you qualify for application fee waivers at other colleges, there’s a good chance you qualify for travel support at Deep Springs.) We make alternative arrangements for international students who cannot afford to travel here as applicants. Please don’t let fear of the travel cost stop you from applying..Who will actually read my application?.Each first-round application is read by 4 members of the Deep Springs community, as facilitated by the Applications Committee (ApCom). Second-round applications are read by ApCom (about a dozen individuals), which also conducts interviews and makes the final decisions. ApCom is chaired by a student and made up predominantly of students..Is there a tuition fee of any kind?.Deep Springs is fully committed to ensuring that all selected applicants who wish to attend are not burdened by financial considerations. For this reason, all students receive a full scholarship valued at over $50,000, which includes tuition, room, and board. Students are expected to provide a small damage deposit and to pay for their own books, travel, medical insurance and incidental expenses. In cases of demonstrated financial need, these costs too can be covered by scholarship. The Dean consults with admitted students to ensure that all expenses are met..How many students do you accept? How many students make it to the second round of the applications process?.We receive around 300 applications each year. Of these, about 40 of the most promising are selected for the second round application and interview. From these second-round applicants, 14 are invited to enroll and 10 are placed on a wait-list. Our goal is an incoming class of 14 students..Is there an age limit?.We do not consider applicants over the age of 23 at the time of application, nor students who have already completed a four-year degree..Is there a testing or GPA cutoff?.We do not practice a GPA cutoff of any kind. However, the academic program at Deep Springs is very rigorous and students should be able to show their ability to perform consistently at a high academic level. Non-native English speakers need to provide proof of English proficiency through the TOEFL, the IELTS, Duolingo, or other equivalent exam..How is my application being judged?.Beyond grades or test scores, competitive applicants should be able to demonstrate curiosity, an ability to reflect upon themselves, a strong work ethic and good communication skills. All of these traits are necessary to succeed in the Three Pillars of our educational program: academics, labor, and self-governance. It is also important that an applicant be interested in pursuing a life of service to humanity after Deep Springs, and that they have a sense of how the college would help them achieve this goal. There is no single type of student that we look for, nor any single criterion that we use in making decisions. Instead, we try to get as complete a view as possible of each applicant before deciding if they are a good “fit” for Deep Springs and if Deep Springs is a good “fit” for them..What are you looking for in essays?.Like the rest of your application, we will read your essays to gain a better sense of the way you think and approach the world. This is an opportunity to show us what really matters to you, where you’ve come from, and how you think. We do value creativity and strong writing skills, but what we’re really looking for is a good understanding of who YOU are and why you want to attend Deep Springs..What if I’ve never been on a farm nor practiced self-governance?.An integral part of the pedagogy at Deep Springs is learning how to learn, learning how to succeed in situations unfamiliar and intimidating. Most students arrive at the college without ever having done farm or ranch work and possessing limited – if any – experience in self-governance. Your background is far less important than your enthusiasm and work ethic in new situations..Does Deep Springs College require standardized test scores?.No. We recently changed our admissions policy to be test-optional..Does Deep Springs College practice affirmative action?.We firmly believe that diversity within higher education is important and valuable, especially in the small, tight-knit community that is Deep Springs. Diversity comes in many forms, and we hope to evaluate each student not only on their potential contributions to the community but also their potential growth. We do not practice quotas of any kind, but always keep in mind the socioeconomic background of each applicant while reading applications..Can I apply early decision to another college and apply to Deep Springs?.You may apply early decision to another college as long as the notification date is on or before December 21. You.must.inform us of withdrawals from the Deep Springs application process before December 22..Do you accept transfer applications?.Yes. Although Deep Springs does not accept credits for advanced standing or award bachelor’s degrees, we are more than happy to read applications from students of a variety of educational backgrounds. We will require transcripts from both your secondary school and your most recent place of higher education..Do you accept international applicants?.Absolutely. For international students, the application process is like the application process for domestic students, with one major exception. If an applicant has not attended an English-speaking secondary school or college, we will ask for proof of English proficiency through the TOEFL, the IELTS, or other equivalent exam. We recommend an international student get a score of 98 or above on the TOEFL, 7 or above on the IELTS, or 130 or above on the Duolingo English Test. Deep Springs does not offer ESL (English as a second language) programs..If I’m accepted, when do I begin classes?.Deep Springs operates year-round, with academic coursework beginning in early July and finishing in late June of the next calendar year. If accepted, you can expect to spend two solid years at Deep Springs, with periodic week-long breaks and one 7-week term off. You can get a sense of our typical schedule by looking at the academic calendar..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Zwischen 6 % und 15 % der Bewerber werden angenommen, damit gehört Deep Springs zu den selektivsten Colleges der Vereinigten Staaten..Deep Springs ist ein.zweijähriges College.. Nur eine sehr kleine Minderheit (drei bis vier pro Jahrzehnt) der Studenten erwirbt nach den zwei Jahren einen Abschluss (.Associate Degree.), da fast alle Absolventen zu diesem Zeitpunkt an ein anderes College wechseln, um ihren.Bachelor.dort nach weiteren zwei Jahren abzuschließen.

Die Studenten sind jedoch stark in die Arbeit auf der Ranch eingebunden. Alle sieben Wochen werden den Studenten Arbeitspositionen zugeordnet, die vom Geschirrspülen über Beherbergung bis zur Geburtshilfe bei Rindern reichen. Die Studenten arbeiten mindestens 20 Stunden pro Woche. Jeder Student kann eine Liste seiner bevorzugten Positionen einreichen, über deren Vergabe wiederum ein anderer Student entscheidet..Die Ranch hat einen ökologisch bewirtschafteten Garten, der einen.Obstgarten., ein.Gewächshaus.,.Komposthaufen., einen Hühnerstall und Gemüsebeete umfasst..Die Rinderherde ist etwa 300 Tiere stark.

Es gibt mehrere Komitees, die sich aus Studenten und Lehrern zusammensetzen. Diese sind etwa für Bewerbungen, den Studienaufbau, die Evaluierung von Studenten und die Kommunikation mit der Außenwelt zuständig.

Here is some feedback that.would make your essay even better..Copy.The essay you've presented is touching, and it shows a sincere reflection on an individual experience during challenging times. However, there are some areas that could be improved:.1. Clarity and Cohesiveness: Your usage of the 'song' metaphor throughout the essay can be a bit confusing. When reading your essay, clarity is essential. Using a clearer approach to express your thoughts would serve you better. Instead of using a metaphor throughout your essay, use it only in certain parts to create an image or elicit emotion..2. Set the Stage: While you mention your location change to Australia and your temporary assignment, you don't mention what it is. A sentence or two explaining what this temporary assignment entailed could give more context to your narrative..3. Specific Examples: You refer to your experiences and lessons learned, such as finding comfort in journal writing and learning guitar. However, it would create a stronger impact if you discuss a specific episode that encapsulates these experiences. For instance, was there a particular entry in your journal that changed your perspective? Did you learn a specific song on the guitar that became your anchor?.4. Concluding Thoughts: Though you conclude with a reflection that you learned to listen to your "slow, warm, and soothing song", the profoundness of this realization might be underplayed. It might be useful to enrich your conclusion by explaining how these experiences will influence your future actions..5. Word Count: Your essay is concise and does not exceed the recommended word limit. By making these suggested changes, your essay could demonstrate an emotional maturity and self-awareness that will stand out to any admissions committee. The resilience you gained through your experiences will undoubtedly serve you well at Georgetown University..Feedback.Great work! Here is some feedback that.you would make yoru essay even better..Copy.The essay brims with passion and communicates a clear sense of what inspires the writer, i.e., music. It paints a vivid picture of how playing music exhilarates the writer and the role it plays in their lives. However, parts of the essay can still be improved to emphasize the candidate's qualities and the effects of their inspiration..1. Informality: The essay is written in a somewhat casual and informal tone. While this makes the essay sound conversational and genuine, an overly casual tone might not be optimal for a college application. For example, phrases like "Hope that helps and brings a smile to your face." may seem too relaxed. Instead, strive for a balance where your unique voice and personality can still shine through, but where your words reflect mature contemplation and seriousness of purpose..2. Lack of Personal Experiences: The essay mentions the enjoyment derived from playing the piano but lacks specific anecdotes or detailed experiences that would elevate the narrative. Details such as moments when you mastered a difficult piece, or when your music particularly resonated with a listener would make the passion tangible..3. Non-Expanded Inspiration: While the essay tells us that the writer finds inspiration in music and revered pianists, it would be beneficial to explain how this inspiration influences other aspects of your life. For instance, does music inspire you to study certain subjects, engage in community service, or view the world in a particular way? This would provide a more well-rounded understanding of your inspiration..4. Connection to Yale: Since this is for a Yale application, consider mentioning how this passion can be further explored at Yale. Maybe there's a specific course or extracurricular activity you’re excited about. This could help display your interest in the university and how smoothly you'd assimilate academically and socially..5. Ending: The essay concludes on a slightly abrupt note. A concluding paragraph that encapsulates your source of inspiration and briefly hints at your future aspirations or goals, tying your passion for music back to your vision for your time at Yale or your career, would round off the essay well. This ties your inspiration to your future, presenting a holistic view of why your inspiration is crucial to you..Feedback.Great work! Here is some feedback that.would make your essay even better..Copy.The essay is a good start. It provides a fair representation of your personality, showing a balance between academic and extracurricular interests, as well as a sense of humor. However, several aspects can be improved for more depth and specificity..1. Show, Don't Tell: You've mentioned your interests, but it's better to offer relevant experiences that visually depict these activities. For example, instead of simply stating your interest in books and soccer, you could relate an incident where knowledge from a novel strategically played a role in a soccer match..2. Harvard Reference: The mention about choosing Harvard appears generic lacking depth; it can be applied to any highly reputable university. Instead, illustrate distinct aspects of Harvard that specifically align with your interests or goals. For example, maybe there's a professor within your chosen major with whom you would love to work..3. Anecdotes or Stories: Adding anecdotes or stories about your community work or your struggle with a bag of gummy bears will not only make the essay more engaging, but it will reveal more about your personality and character..4. Clearer Transitions: The transitions between different parts of the essay can be smoother and more natural. For instance, you abruptly switch from talking about soccer to Harvard which may confuse readers momentarily. A transitional sentence could mitigate this issue..5. Values and Character Traits: Try to provide implicit insights into your values or character traits through your experiences and interests. For instance, volunteering indicates a sense of responsibility and commitment to the welfare of others. Your fascination for books could demonstrate intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness..6. Conclusion: The ending could be more impactful or persuasive. Instead of just hoping for great times at Harvard, you could express enthusiasm about contributing positively to Harvard and its community with your future roommate. Remember, the purpose of this essay is to demonstrate what you would contribute to the Harvard community and how you would engage with your future roommate. Tailoring anecdotes to reveal more about your character and aspirations will allow the essay to resonate better with the committee..‹.›.Why The Princeton Review.Experience unbeatable value with rapid response times and superior quality..Price.Turnaround.Quality.AI College Admissions Essay Counseling.$83/month., Unlimited usage.Instant.Steady high-quality.Human-based services.About $1,000 for 10 essays.7 days.Varies by coach.Unlimited AI essay counseling.Lifetime access to feedback.Spelling & Grammar Review.Essays reviewed for:.Clarity and Coherence.Grammar and Spelling.Structural Strength.Compelling Storytelling.Prompts Relevance.Conciseness.Best Value.$250.($83/month for 3 months).$99.($99/month for 1 month).Add to Cart.First Name:.Last Name:.Zip Code:.Phone Number:.Email:.I need help:.Select.Right away.In a few weeks.Unsure.I am a:.Select.Student.Parent.Professional.Educator.Admissions Officer.Student Type:.Select.High School Student.College or Graduate Student.Subject:.Select.Elementary Math.Midlevel Math.Algebra.Algebra II.Geometry.Trigonometry.Pre-Calculus.Calculus.Statistics.Intermediate Statistics.Finite Math.Elementary Science.Biology.Earth Science.Chemistry.Organic Chemistry.Algebra-based Physics.Calculus-based Physics.Anatomy & Physiology.History.English.Essay Writing.ELL.Primary ELL.Reading.Primary Reading.Literature.Grammar.Intro Psychology.Spanish.MS PowerPoint.MS Word.Windows.Career Help.Test Type:.Academic.ACT.Admissions.AP.DAT.Digital SAT.GMAT.GRE.LSAT.MCAT.OAT.SAT.SHSAT.TeamSnap.By submitting my contact number and email address, I certify that I am 18 years of age or older, agree to be contacted regarding The Princeton Review’s services, and agree to terms & conditions..Contact Us Now.Response time: Within.1 business day.Enrollment Advisor.1-800-2REVIEW.(800-273-8439) ext. 1.1-877-LEARN-30.FAQ.Hours.Mon-Fri 9AM-10PM ET.Sat-Sun 9AM-8PM ET.Student Support.1-800-2REVIEW.(800-273-8439) ext. 2.1-877-LEARN-30.FAQ.Hours.Mon-Fri 9AM-9PM ET.Sat-Sun 8:30AM-5PM ET.Partnerships.Teach or Tutor for Us.College Readiness.International.Advertising.Affiliate/Other.About.Enrollment Terms & Conditions.Accessibility.Cigna Medical.Transparency in Coverage.Register Book.Go.Hours.Mon-Fri 9AM-10PM ET.Sat-Sun 9AM-8PM ET.Hours.Mon-Fri 9AM-9PM ET.Sat-Sun 8:30AM-5PM ET.College.SAT.ACT.PSAT.AP Tests.SAT Subject Tests.Graduate.GRE.GMAT.LSAT.MCAT.DAT.OAT.Academic Subjects.Math.Science.English.Social Studies.AP Support.Find the Right College.College Rankings.College Advice.Applying to College.Financial Aid.School & District Partnerships.K-12 Home.Tutor.com.Test Prep.Professional Development.About Us.Resources.Webinars.Advice Articles.Videos.LiveOnline.Private Tutoring.Mobile Apps.International Offices.Counselors.About.About.Teach or Tutor for Us.Work for Us.Affiliate Program.Partner with Us.Advertise with Us.Media.Contact.International Partnerships.Our Guarantees.Enrollment.Terms & Conditions.Accessibility.Accessibility – Canada.Cigna Medical.Transparency in Coverage.Privacy Policy.|.CA Privacy Notice.|.Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.|.Your Opt-Out Rights.|.Terms of Use.|.Site Map.©2024 TPR Education IP Holdings, LLC.

Many community college students successfully transfer to top universities each year. Elite universities often have specific transfer programs and pathways in place to facilitate this process..Here are some tips to increase your chances of successfully transferring from a community college to an elite university:.Maintain a strong GPA: Elite universities typically have high academic standards, so it's important to excel academically at the community college level..Take challenging courses: Take challenging courses at your community college that align with your intended major at the university you wish to transfer to. This will demonstrate your academic preparedness for the rigors of the elite university..Get involved in extracurricular activities: Participate in extracurricular activities that demonstrate your leadership skills, community involvement, and interests outside of academics..Build relationships with professors: Cultivate relationships with your professors at the community college who can write strong letters of recommendation for your transfer applications..Research transfer requirements: Each university may have specific transfer requirements, so make sure to research these early on and plan your coursework accordingly..Seek guidance from advisors: Community colleges often have transfer advisors who can provide guidance on the transfer process, application requirements, and deadlines..Write a compelling personal statement: Your personal statement is an important part of your transfer application. Use this opportunity to explain why you are interested in transferring to the specific university and how you will contribute to the campus community..Remember, transferring to an elite university from a community college may require careful planning, hard work, and dedication, but it is definitely achievable with the right approach and preparation..Upvote.·.Zeontello ..8y.I graduated high school in 2013.

I finished with a 2.3 gpa and I actually didnt even know if I was graduating until our class was 3 days from walking. That isn't to say that I was dumb, I scored a 2250 on my SAT and I didn't even study for it. I just didn't take high school very seriously..Needless to say, my only option was to attend a community college. I settled on going to De Anza, a community college in Cupertino, that happened to be one of the best community colleges in the country, despite the fact that 4 community colleges were closer. My commute was a 2 1/2 hour bus ride; my parents refused to let me borrow one of their cars because they thought that I was an idiot for going so far for school..I decided to major in computer science, and really enjoyed the classes. For the first time in my life, I took my classes seriously, and I had to sign up for a grand total of just 3 classes I had no interest in. I did really well, and I had a perfect 4.0 gpa after my first year. I ended up applying to a lot of colleges and I got accepted by quite a few. Some of the really big schools that accepted me: Stanford, Harvard, Cal tech, University of Chicago, Cornell, UCLA, and UC Berekley..I now attend Harvard, and while there is a stigma of being a transfer student at Harvard (some fellow classmates look down on me because I'm a transfer student), most people are pretty cool and nice..Tldr: Yes, you can get into any college you would like to as a transfer student, but you might have to work very hard and you might be unhappy with the stigma that comes from being a transfer student..Upvote.·.99.62.9.7.9.1.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit?

I ultimately decided on Berkeley. Some of my peers transferred to UCLA, Stanford, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, and other top flagship universities..General Advice.For community college students, if you have the opportunity to take advanced classes/honors courses take them, they will help you prepare for the road ahead. Consider looking into opportunities to do research under a professor or organization, look into cross enrolling into a nearby university, if the there's a concurrent enrollment program connected with your community college. Do activities which you are genuinely interested in; if you concerned that you activity isn’t as ‘cool’ or ‘prestigious’, don’t worry, you can make them ‘prestigious’ by showing your tremendous dedication, and effort toward that activity..In my experience the path towards transferring to a top-public university is fairly straightforward, given that most state universities have explicit transfer agreements with community colleges..For example, in California, if you wanted to transfer to any of the 9 University of California (UC's) or 23 California State University's (CSU's) campuses you could see all of the classes you would need to take on.ASSIST.org., which is an online student-transfer information system specifically designed to help students & counselors at community colleges determine the courses needed to transfer to a UC or CSU..What if you wanted to transfer to a private school?.The best option you have is to visit the website of the institution you plan on transferring into and find their transfer resources or contact the university to talk to an admissions specialist..Concerning community college transferable work to private university transferable coursework, I had a friend who transferred to Stanford. He originally had no intentions on even applying there, but decided on applying last-minute..To his surprise, he discovered that the rigorous coursework he had been taking to transfer to UC Berkeley was comparable to Stanford..Concerning Grades, Standing Out & Telling Your Story:.A few anecdotes:.I applied to Berkeley with a 3.9/4.0 GPA, had taken a several honors courses at my community college, conducted research under my professors, demonstrated deep level commitment to the volunteer work I did outside of school because I genuinely found it interesting, I took an unplanned gap year during my second year at community college to work to alleviate financial strains at home and spent a lot of time trying out new things to find out what I really enjoyed doing and what I wanted to do. You’d be surprised how fast you can grow both academically and personally when you are truly pursuing something you find interesting..A friend of mine who transferred to Stanford (also admitted to UC Berkeley) had about a 3.9 GPA, good SAT scores, had taken honors level courses, presented research at symposiums and had a diverse set of life experiences. After graduating high school, he took two years off from school, traveled many places and worked..Another friend transferred to Cornell with about 3.8+, took honors courses, was active on campus, worked, and also presented research at symposiums..It goes without saying, you need to demonstrate that your academically capable and able to compete at the same level as the students at the universities you want to transfer into. In my opinion & from what I've gathered, it's not just about grades (though you be aiming for the best grades you can). Demonstrating grit, a genuine interest in what you do and you're uniqueness is important, especially since most students on paper look very similiar when vying for places at competitive institutions..If you feel that you are an ‘untraditional’ student, that is you come from a non-traditional background (military, student parent, re-entry student etc), I believe that only helps you more since you can bring to the classroom a set of experiences that are uncommon in classroom..Articles of transfer student success stories::.SAN MARCOS: Palomar graduate John Aragon heads to Yale.Transfer Students' Stanford.Harvard Lags in Community College Recruitment | News | The Harvard Crimson.From community college to the Ivy League - yes, it's possible.From community college to the Ivy League and elite institutions.Some resources for community college students (some are California-centric):.ASSIST.ORG.- find the classes you need to take as a california community college student.The Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative.- summer research at top universities (my friend who transferred to Yale did a Yale summer research program - I believe that helped him set him apart as a serious student).Los Medanos College - Bay Honors Consortium - Honors Research Symposium.- california community college research symposium.

This level of participation in corporate life, is sometimes even difficult to find at the Board level of a corporation (where culture may mean such matters are in the hands of a few)..FWIW, it is certainly neither a cruise ship, nor a continual party, to use some of the more pejorative characterizations of institutions today.

Depending on where you transfer and on what you decide to major in, it may take 2-3 years of additional coursework to complete a Bachelor’s. In recent years, Deep Springs graduates have most commonly finished their degrees at Yale, Brown, Stanford, Columbia, University of Chicago and other well-regarded universities and colleges..Some students choose not to immediately attend another college, preferring to travel, work or volunteer for a year or two. Ultimately, over 95% complete a Bachelor’s and more than half of alumni go on to receive graduate and terminal degrees..Deep Springs’ ethos of training students for a ‘life of service’ is engendered in myriad ways. Common fields among DS alumni include: law, journalism, medicine, teaching, scientific research, university teaching, computer engineering, non-profit administration, and business entrepreneurship, in addition to agriculture, ecology and the arts.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify.

That said, Deep Springs is completely unlike any of those institutions..Deep Springs is small: its 25 students wouldn't fill one residence hall (hovse) at Caltech..Deep Springs is isolated: the college occupies a desert valley in eastern California between Los Angeles and Reno, many miles from the nearest town, Big Pine, California and the (student-enforced) Isolation Policy restricts outside interactions..Deep Springs Students have an unusual amount of control over the college: an elected student Trustee is a full voting member of the small board of trustees. The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation.

Not everyone gets a $120k plus per annum salary package where you can pay off your student loan in 2–3 yrs. This thing might happen to only 1–2 people out of a group of 40 Indian students and I’m here to talk about the rest of 39–38 students or at least the average of them..(Even getting admitted to a top University or getting a job in top companies doesn’t put you in a safe zone for your career. Immigration policies & laws are the same for all. ).For this question,.I would prefer to think about my ROI ( Return of Investment)..I took a huge amount of loan (Rs. 40 Lakhs in 2014) to cover my whole fees and I have to make sure that paying it back all in 2–3 yrs, or at least I paid like 70–75% of it before I return to my country India..And why I’m saying within 3 yrs, it's simple after graduation I can work a total of 3 yrs in the US under OPT only if my program comes under STEM, if it doesn’t come under STEM like MBA or MS in Finance, Entrepreneurship, etc. programs, etc. I have only a year after my graduation to find an employer to hire me plus work for them and also apply for my H1b work visa, all within 1 year period of time for Non-STEM, for STEM we have 3 yrs..Now comes the scary part,.most US companies don’t want to hire International students just because they would need sponsorship in the future..Here’s a job rejection letter from TOYOTA USA..See for yourself, below..Yes, that’s Toyota, USA..Rejecting jobs because they don’t want to sponsor the US visa..And many other US companies (.like Cree Inc.).are not providing US visa sponsorships options for international students to stay & work in the USA in the future..In.Valeo., not even hiring F1 international students also..And many more..Finally, when u get employed u got 3 times in 3 yrs ( only for STEM) to get the file for an H1b visa, but here’s a reality check what makes u think your employer would keep on filing for an H1b every year until u get approved. I knew a guy from my colleges, first-year he didn’t get selected in the lottery, the second year he got selected in the lottery but his company failed to provide strong evidence required to approve RFE to USCIS and then his application was rejected and also the amount didn’t refund back to his employer, but in 3rd yr, his company gave him heartbreaking news of not filing his H1-b visa again but he got to keep his employment till the end of his OPT and yes he still got a hell of an amount to pay back his education loan when he returned to his country..It’s simple to understand how an H1B visa works, your employer files for you if u don’t get selected at lottery pickups, you may try again next yr. but if u get selected, Congrats! now that’s half the work done, another half they gonna do a hard background checking of you and your company if they find any single doubt they may ask u or the company to provide evidence if any of u fail to provide, ur H1b application can get rejected. For ex. if your company has a history of tax fraud or someone tried to sued ur company in past, etc., this could be some of the reasons for H1b rejection, but it could be diverted if your company provides a strong statement or evidence. An employer has to provide strong support for why they failed to hire Americans and they filed visas for any international candidate.A report suggests there has been a 40% rejection rate after getting a pickup from the lottery acc. USCIS stats report and the number might still grow as they’re still processing applications..H1b is a very outdated biased lottery-based selection program, where a candidate with one degree and with “zero” work experiences have the same chances of getting H1b lottery pickup compare to another candidate with (let’s say) advanced degrees & with 10 years of work experiences, also involves huge processing time ( like 6–10 months or even 1-year), a lot of expenses ( depends upon the company’s size), requires a lot of paper works ( like RFE’s), have to fly back to home country for visa stamping (a lot of chances the visa interview may get rejected & the applicant stuck in the home country)..Plus a lot of other complications and Trump’s restrictive policies, like “.Buy American and Hire American.” policies have alarmed & put a lot of pressure on US companies to hire only Americans ( even if they’re unfit for the role)..Other things that make Indian graduates in US life hard are: Every year or maybe every semester they are increasing fees everywhere ( Like tuition fees, CPT, OPT fees, also US application fees they increase up to 80% of it, etc.). Not everyone gets a scholarship even though if u have the best profile ( Most of the scholarships are available for their American Kids), Not everyone gets RA or TA, this is a very limited position and also depends upon the funds being received by those professors to continue their research and hire RA or TA, if there aren’t any funds then he won’t hire or pay his students and also lots of colleges TA and RA positions are given priority to Ph.D. students first. Not everyone lands a job in big companies, u may get employed in medium or small size.companies where on average they pay $60–$70k per yr and trust me u won’t be able to pay off all your student loans in those 2–3 yrs because you will have your own living expenses in the US like, Rents, paying bills, utility bills, financing a car, insurance, transportation, etc..Even in a professional career, no one can guarantee to have a secure life, companies can kick u out anytime and we can’t do anything about it., then who’s gonna take care of me, help me pay my loans, rents, bills. Maybe your friends can help hopefully if ur that closes to them. If you lose your job in H1b then you have 60 days to find a new job with an H1b transfer or leave the country. Very very stressful & depressing times..Now let’s talk ab 2 yr Master's courses, Oh boy! the courses are way-way-way too hard..For example.,.in all the mathematics courses, Numerical Integration when the numerical needs to be solved using MS Excel & MATLAB. I never learned MATLAB in my whole life before moving to the US, now I have to learn MATLAB first and who’s gonna teach that? American kids learned MATLAB in their 11–12th grade, they learned CAD designing in 12th grade and I learned in my 2nd yr of B.Tech. Other courses require me to learn MINITAB, similarly, American kids already know about MINITAB. Remember it's Mandatory to maintain more than a 3.0 GPA out of 4.0 to maintain an F1 student visa or else u will be in deep trouble..Professors are not gonna teach u the kinds of stuff that are already taught in American High School..Now it’s all on us to learn and complete our assignments. Not to forget with all this u also have a part-time job where u will be working min. 20hrs in a week. Before graduation, in your last sem. u have to apply for an EAD card/OPT and guess what increased along with the application fees, they have also increased the processing time from 90 days to 150 days,.which means even if u have an offer letter u cannot start working until u receive EAD card.& to think about it 5 months? ( Since you graduated from College, u can’t even work on-campus jobs, so no income for 5 months also) why in hell the company will hold for u for 5 months and not think about replacing u with someone else who’s ready to join immediately, and USCIS always sends these EAD cards through the United States Postal Services ( like our India Post service) and I hear most of the time they delay in delivery to the addresses or they misplace the packages which ultimately means they misplaced your EAD card, and no one can be held responsible, u can’t do anything but just to apply again and pay fees again and wait for another 5 months of processing time..Guys, there is a hell of lots of things & I’m pretty sure you're not aware of any of it and I can talk about it all day, all week. Just think, I took a 40 lakhs loan when $1 = Rs 64, and now it's Rs.74, so probably u will be applying a much bigger amount than me. Next year it may hit Rs. 75–80 ( check the forecast by economist, there are no possibilities of INR getting strong in front of USD )..And also technically there are no green cards for Indian & China-born citizens since and added both countries in the backlog of processing time of more than 25 to 150 years so even forget it any American company sponsoring green cards. A bill named HR1044/S386 was created to pass in the house to remove this country-based discrimination but NO, it didn’t pass & was blocked further..So guys, in my words, It’s not worthy at all, the US has lost that worthiness term a long time ago..It doesn’t matter how hard you work, what sacrifice you may do, the US politics, laws, policies will always put hard-hitting scenarios for us,.it’s simply because we are not US citizens, they have all the rights, not us!.If you’re so passionate about going abroad then do keep options of exploring other countries also like Canada with point-based permanent residency..Plus, how unsafe America is nowadays with heightening racism ( we all seen BLM mass protest and also white-supremacist protest, plus many Americans believes we are cheap laborers who took away their rightful jobs) & gun violence where many Indian students were killed. Click the link below..International Students Association's answer to Do people of Indian origin feel safe in America?.I thought this a valuable info. so I’m adding it..Below is a chart, that’s describing how much tax deductions are been deducted. So these are the top well-known cities in the US..The salaries and wages depend upon location in the US. But on average, a young engineer should make around $60k- 75k per year in the US..So, below describes if your salary package is $75,000/ year and this is how much you will be getting back in your bank account after tax deductions..Well, let’s take an example of Boston, after getting $52,824 ( which means approx. $4,500 per month)..One Bhk apartment rent costs around $2,200–2,6000 per month. ( over $30,000 per year excluding house deposit & security fees.).Utility bills ( wifi, electricity, and gas ) cost around $200 per month, and in winter it gets higher like $250 in big cities..Transportation, car-insurance, Gasoline, groceries, parking tickets, etc. are damn crazy expensive..There are a lot of other expenses, like credit bills, etc..I have got a lot of data, I can share but I don’t want to bore you..As you can get an idea of how crazy expensive is America, everything is expensive. And taxes will go higher in the next year 2021 since America is officially under recession, their federal debt is around 26.8 trillion dollars. Next year it will be 27 trillion dollars which equals USA GDP...Just think of yourself, how freakingly hard it will be to pay educational loans from Indian banks whose EMI will be somewhere Rs. 70,000 maximum per month for whole MS fees of more than 40–45 Lacs. Also, this EMI has a tenure of 10 years so they actually start EMI on 3rd year after MS college graduation, and calculated EMI’s are based on 8 years tenure..PS. I’m not a banking expert but this is what happens to me and my friends..Imagine if denied H1b or no job opportunities in the US due to harsh US immigration. How is it possible to pay Rs. 70,000 per month on Indian salaries..Do a lot of extensive research, think about your family too especially if they’re getting retire and old. Don’t leave your parents behind in debt..I’m not here to coerce you, since I don’t know you nor I’m getting anything in return for putting a lot of effort into posting. My work was just to put the real picture in front of you & the decision is always yours to make since even I wish if someone could have done it for me..Bless you..Upvote.·.999.240.99.10.9.5.Sponsored by Online Shopping Tools.Amazon Hates When Prime Members Do This, But They Can't Stop You..This simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it..Learn More.1.6K.1.6K.Related questions.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.What is the best way to get into Deep Springs College as a transfer?.Do college students still attend Deep Springs?

Long-term staff and professors also receive retirement benefits, medical insurance, financial support for professional development, and sabbatical leaves..There are faculty and staff houses and apartments around the main circle of the upper ranch, where the library, classrooms, and boardinghouse are located. Other homes are located at the lower ranch and Henderson Station, one mile down the road. Community members are welcome to eat at the boardinghouse, which offers three meals per weekday and two each on Sunday and Saturday. Faculty and staff homes are also equipped with their own kitchens. Special dietary needs can be accommodated. The college produces nearly all of its own beef and dairy, as well as some chicken and pork. The garden turns out a cornucopia of delicious vegetables. Meals are lively social occasions, full of laughter and conversation. Occasionally, community members will conspire to cook a feast of their own..The Student Body’s isolation policy does not apply to faculty and staff, but all community members share the benefits of the campus’s isolated location. Bishop, CA, the nearest town with a selection of stores and restaurants, is forty miles away over a mountain pass. Las Vegas and Reno airports are four and five hours distant, respectively. Los Angeles and San Francisco are about six and eight. This isolation emphasizes the stark, tranquil beauty of the landscape. Deep Springs Valley is rimmed by the Inyo-White Mountains and in view of the Sierra Nevada, two of the country’s most gorgeous mountain ranges. Opportunities to run, hike, and bike abound beyond the campus. And for the times when faculty or staff simply need to get away, there are plenty of attractions nearby: Palisade Glacier, Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, Alabama Hills, Mono Lake, Death Valley National Park, Yosemite National Park, Devil’s Postpile National Monument, and the Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort. Numerous trailheads leading into the eastern Sierra are within 1 to 2 hours’ drive from the college..Professors and staff often bring their children with them. As of 2020, four minor children are in residence. Pediatricians, hospitals, childcare, schools, groceries, and department stores are all located in Bishop. The wide-open spaces, friendly community, and the absence of traffic create an environment in which children thrive. The friends and relatives of community members are welcome to visit, and the college maintains guest accommodations that are often available for short-term visitors..Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

We hope you will consider designating a percent of your estate to Deep Springs..No matter your age and stage, we encourage you to take a minute to think about how you might make an impact with what you have when you no longer need it.  Or to sit down with your partner or spouse to discuss how you anticipate supporting the ones you love and the institutions and causes that matter the most to you.  Just starting a family?  That’s a perfect time for the conversation even if your plans change..L.L. Nunn made the first planned gift to Deep Springs in establishing his Trust. Scores of other donors have done so since, and planned gifts are now a major component of our fiscal health and projection..Please consider joining the L.L. Nunn Society by naming Deep Springs as a beneficiary in your will or of a trust, annuity, 401K, TIAA (or other) brokerage account, or life insurance policy.

This has become a.very popular.form of annual gift to Deep Springs College for a couple of reasons..First, the money has to come out of the fund by law, so it might feel like “found money.”  And second, if instead of withdrawing the money for another purpose, it goes directly from your IRA to a verified 501(c)(3) like Deep Springs, then the income is not taxed.  This means you get to pass the savings along to Deep Springs– a great “win-win.”.Please ask your financial institution about RMDs..Matching Gift Contributions.Please ask your employer or organization for information on matching gift eligibility. Many companies have conjoined foundations to match charitable giving by their employees. If your company has such a program, please name Deep Springs College in the gift matching documentation..Contributions of Goods or Services.For an in-kind gift, please contact the Development Director (whose contact info is at the top of this page) with a description and value of the gift.

Classes are discussion-based and intensive, with a focus on critical thinking, writing, and intellectual inquiry..In addition to their academic work, students at Deep Springs are required to participate in manual labor on the college's working cattle ranch and farm. This work is an integral part of the educational experience at Deep Springs, providing students with practical skills and a deeper understanding of the relationship between intellectual and manual labor..Overall, the academics at Deep Springs College are challenging and demanding, but they also offer students a unique and transformative educational experience.

The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation.

This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".Upvote.·.99.13.Related questions.What is the professional world’s view of Deep Springs College?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.What does it take to be accepted at Deep Springs College?.How has Deep Springs College changed since it became coed?.Are there any international students at Deep Springs College?.Where did you go, and what did you do after attending Deep Springs College?.Do college students still attend Deep Springs?

With the number of.undergraduates.restricted to 26, the college is one of the smallest institutions of higher education in the United States..[1].[a].Though it offers an.associate degree., most students transfer into a.four-year college.after completing their studies. Those enrolled pay.no tuition.and are given.room and board...Founded in 1917 as.Deep Springs Collegiate and Preparatory., it was originally a.men's college.backed by funding from.L. L. Nunn., a lawyer and businessman. Nunn envisioned an unorthodox form of education that combined academic rigor, manual labor, and self-governance. Located in a.geological depression., its campus is situated within a.cattle ranch.with the aim of providing a secluded environment away from urban life so undergraduates may focus on their studies and leadership ability. The college is primarily maintained and.self-governed.by students, becoming a.coeducational.institution in 2018..The college's alumni include.Rhodes.and.Truman.Scholars, two.Pulitzer Prize.recipients, three.MacArthur Fellows., and winners of an.Emmy.and.Lawrence Award., among multiple.academics.and.congressmen...History.[.edit.].L.L. Nunn., a graduate of.Harvard Law School., founded Deep Springs.Deep Springs was founded in 1917 by.L. L. Nunn., a.business magnate.who made a fortune building.alternating current.power plants.in the.Western United States.. Nunn's first projects—a hydroelectric plant in.Telluride, Colorado., and the.Olmsted Power Station.in.Provo, Utah.—served as the foundation for his inspiration to create a new type of educational institution..[3].As it became difficult to find enough engineers capable of living under rough conditions, he began schooling local men and pursued an interest in education..[4].Nunn eventually sold his industrial assets to fund the.Telluride Association., an educational trust based at.Cornell University., and the.Telluride House...[5].After becoming dissatisfied with the association's mission, he founded Deep Springs and helped in its administration until his death in 1925..[6].The establishment of Deep Springs was a reaction to what Nunn saw as a decline in academic standards in traditional American colleges..[7].His philosophy governing Deep Springs focused strictly around the pursuit of "academics, labor, and self-governance", something he dubbed the "three pillars" which supported the "whole man"..[8].The inclusion of manual labor in a college's educational program was unusual in 1917, but a number of so-called.manual labor colleges.had existed in the United States in the 19th century—including, at one time,.Oberlin College., which Nunn attended..[9].By the early 1860s, most had either closed or had abandoned their manual labor programs..[10].These pillars entailed students playing an active role in the administration of the college by laboring in the field and contributing to student meetings during committees, which Nunn believed was an effective method of producing "leaders for a democratic society"..[5].To this end, the.board of trustees., which Nunn established to preserve the college's traditions, contained one—later two—seats that were reserved for student trustees, who were elected by the.student body.and currently remain with full voice and voting rights..[11].Due to his correspondence with these early student bodies, Nunn decided the college would provide student housing and would not include a.tuition...[12].In the 1990s, the school's leadership debated transitioning the college to be.coeducational.. Whereas many women in the Telluride Association advocated for the change, a large portion of the school's alumni wished to keep its status as a men's college..[13].Though the board of Deep Springs voted against making any change in 1994, the college later accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan from Telluride under the condition that Deep Springs would begin admitting women by 2019..[14].In 2011, the college's trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees' action..[15].The challengers disputed the authority of the college's board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year..[16].[17].On April 13, 2017, the.California Court of Appeal.ruled that the college could admit women in.Hitz v. Hoekstra...[18].With the.Supreme Court of California.declining to hear an appeal,.[19].the board of trustees voted once again to admit women, with the first female students arriving in July 2018..[20].[21].Curriculum.[.edit.].Deep Springs students and staff moving cattle.Deep Springs involves students working on tasks in the nearby ranch including "cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, and fixing vehicles" with the.academic curriculum.dedicated wholly to the.liberal arts.such as.Ancient Greek., philosophy, political science, and literature..[1].Classes are taught by a long-term.faculty.—the.president.,.dean., and.chairs.of the.natural science.and.humanities.department—and a division of visiting professors and scholars which make up the short-term faculty, neither of which may hold.tenure...[22].Undergraduates work a minimum of 20 hours a week,.[23].rotating tasks while also studying for their classes..[12].Students attend classes during the morning and spend the afternoon working on the ranch..[24].Though the majority of learning is loosely regulated and done mainly through informal discussions, there are two required courses: freshman composition and public speaking..[25].After graduation, approximately two-thirds of the student body transfer to an.Ivy League.university or another similarly ranked institution,.[26].[27].with a substantial portion going on to attend.Cornell University.,.Brown University.or the.University of California, Berkeley...[12].[28].Self-governance is a critical part of the Deep Springs educational program. Students hold decision-making authority in determinations about admissions, curriculum, and faculty hiring. Every student serves on one of four standing committees during their time as a student: Applications (ApCom), Curriculum (CurCom), Communications (ComCom) or Review and Reinvitations (RCom). The Communications Committee (ComCom) was created in the early 1990s and charged with shaping the policies that define the college's relations with the world at large..[.citation needed.].Campus.[.edit.].View from main ranch to Deep Springs Valley.Deep Springs College is isolated within.Deep Springs Valley., a.geological depression.between the.White.and.Inyo.mountain ranges, with the nearest sizable town being.Bishop, California., and the closest.commercial airport.being in.Las Vegas...[23].With the college's campus consisting primarily of its 32,000-acre (13,000 ha) ranch,.[23].its physical isolation plays a central role in the educational experience. The college also contains a.bookstore.,.post office., and a.library., all maintained by students..[29].Partly due to Nunn's previous experience closing down a school in.Virginia.due to students deserting campus,.[23].the school's "isolation policy" forbids students from leaving the college's campus and prohibits the use of.alcohol...[7].Deep Springs used to have a direct telephone line crossing the White Mountains, but difficult maintenance made service unsustainable..[30].The line was replaced in the 1980s by a wireless radio link connecting to the Bishop.central office.. Because the radio signal is relayed using a repeater station high in the White Mountains, and because the first relay out of Deep Springs Valley does not have.line of sight., the system is subject to outages caused by high winds and inclement weather. Previously, the college's Internet connection was an unusually slow 14.4 kbit/s data channel.multiplexed.into the radio link. Not later than 2011, the college connected to the.internet by satellite...[31].Deep Springs has an.FM radio.-based.Voice over Internet Protocol.phone system,.[31].and.direct inward dialing...[32].A small.seismic station.exists behind the main campus, installed by the former.Soviet Union.as part of a bi-national underground nuclear test monitoring agreement..[33].Alumni.[.edit.].Despite the small number of admitted students, Deep Springs disproportionately produces members of academia with the majority of graduates going on to receive.doctorates.;.[34].these include multiple scholars, professors, authors, scientists, and.members of government.. The college's alumni have been awarded.Rhodes.and.Truman.Scholarships, three.MacArthur "genius grants"., two.Pulitzer Prizes., one.Emmy award., and one.E. O. Lawrence Award., among other honors.

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools.. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to.comcom@deepsprings.edu...To make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page.here...Academics.Like the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

The college is known for its small size, with a student body of fewer than 30 students, and its remote location in the high desert of California..Deep Springs College offers a two-year liberal arts education with a strong focus on academics, labor, and self-governance. Students are actively involved in the operation of the college, including tasks such as farming, cooking, and maintenance work in addition to their academic studies. This hands-on approach to education is one of the key aspects that set Deep Springs apart from more traditional colleges and universities..The college has a highly selective admissions process and a strong emphasis on intellectual rigor, critical thinking, and community engagement. Graduates of Deep Springs often go on to pursue further education at top universities or make significant contributions in various fields..While Deep Springs College may not be the right fit for everyone due to its unique structure and remote location, it is considered by many to be a transformative and enriching educational experience for those who thrive in its challenging and unconventional environment. It has garnered a reputation for fostering a strong sense of community, intellectual curiosity, and personal growth among its students..Ultimately, whether Deep Springs College is as unparalleled as the media reports may depend on individual perspectives and priorities in education. It is important for prospective students to thoroughly research and consider the college's distinctive features to determine if it aligns with their academic and personal goals..Upvote.·.Paul Michelsen.Retired Large Animal Veterinarian.·.Author has.81.answers and.486.6K.answer views.·.Updated 7y.I have direct experience with Stanford (undergraduate degree) and UC Davis (graduate degrees) and indirect experience with Caltech (my son is a Caltech alum) and will compare my experience at Deep Springs with them.

Deep Springs is probably most like Caltech in that it is small, very highly selective, generous with financial aid and students bond over shared experiences which the outside world doesn't understand. That said, Deep Springs is completely unlike any of those institutions..Deep Springs is small: its 25 students wouldn't fill one residence hall (hovse) at Caltech..Deep Springs is isolated: the college occupies a desert valley in eastern California between Los Angeles and Reno, many miles from the nearest town, Big Pine, California and the (student-enforced) Isolation Policy restricts outside interactions..Deep Springs Students have an unusual amount of control over the college: an elected student Trustee is a full voting member of the small board of trustees. The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation. I am the only member of my class with an occupation even remotely related to agriculture (I am a retired veterinarian): others are MDs, lawyers, college professors, artists and writers..You can see the Milky Way on any moonless night; not true of any of the other colleges I have been to..Upvote.·.99.35.9.2.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet..Upvote.·.999.410.999.121.99.18.Related questions.More answers below.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.What is the best way to get into Deep Springs College as a transfer?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.Do college students still attend Deep Springs?

He later described the experience as extremely rigorous -- they did not simply assume he was qualified,  but grilled him extensively on his work,  teaching methods and how he would fit into Deep Springs..I understand that,  due to coverage a few years ago,  awareness of Deep Springs is now growing in China.  This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".Upvote.·.99.13.Sanjay Kapila.doesn't go here, heard a lot about it though.·.9y.Assuming you have read the other answers describing Deep Springs as a school, I will skip the formalities and tell you this: If you want an account from a former Deep Springs student yourself, read John D'Agata's.Notes Toward the Making of a Whole Human Being..

Deep Springs is probably most like Caltech in that it is small, very highly selective, generous with financial aid and students bond over shared experiences which the outside world doesn't understand. That said, Deep Springs is completely unlike any of those institutions..Deep Springs is small: its 25 students wouldn't fill one residence hall (hovse) at Caltech..Deep Springs is isolated: the college occupies a desert valley in eastern California between Los Angeles and Reno, many miles from the nearest town, Big Pine, California and the (student-enforced) Isolation Policy restricts outside interactions..Deep Springs Students have an unusual amount of control over the college: an elected student Trustee is a full voting member of the small board of trustees. The students have final say in hiring faculty, new student admissions and "re-invitation" of returning students. They are in full control of their living space: the college president cannot enter a student room without permission..Deep Springs is free: all students are on a full room, board and tuition scholarship..Deep Springs is not a "farm school". It is located on a cattle ranch, but the mandatory labor program also includes jobs in the library, as cooks in the "boarding house" and other areas of the college operation. I am the only member of my class with an occupation even remotely related to agriculture (I am a retired veterinarian): others are MDs, lawyers, college professors, artists and writers..You can see the Milky Way on any moonless night; not true of any of the other colleges I have been to..Upvote.·.99.35.9.2.Sponsored by Online Shopping Tools.Amazon Hates When Prime Members Do This, But They Can't Stop You..This simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it..Learn More.1.6K.1.6K.Related questions.More answers below.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.Is Deep Springs College hard to get into?.Are there any international students at Deep Springs College?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.What makes Deep Springs College graduates so successful in the transfer process?

He later described the experience as extremely rigorous -- they did not simply assume he was qualified,  but grilled him extensively on his work,  teaching methods and how he would fit into Deep Springs..I understand that,  due to coverage a few years ago,  awareness of Deep Springs is now growing in China.  This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".Upvote.·.99.13.Paul Michelsen.Retired Large Animal Veterinarian.·.Author has.81.answers and.486.6K.answer views.·.8y.Related.Can any Deep Springs College alumni tell me what the most fulfilling part of their experience was?.The most fulfilling aspect was being part of an interdependent community.

You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better?

This may be due to the particular resonance of Deep Springs' ideals of something like a "farmer intellectual" with the PRC's ideals..Deep Springs' direct democracy and control by the students,  is alas relatively unique and rare in the United States..The level of direct responsibility given the students,  as well as many policies,  including those regarding alcohol and drugs and that against leaving the Valley during term,   are quite different than the administrative parentalism which is all-but-pervasive at US educational institutions..Deep Springs also retains and preserves much of the ethos and history of the industrialist who founded it,  L.L. Nunn,  who was responsible for the small innovation known as alternating current electrical transmission,  and once a primary stakeholder in many power utilities,  including Westinghouse Electric,  Utah Power & Light and Pacific Gas & Electric..One thus might well think of Deep Springs,  as a creation of the Google of its day..While farm operations take up a good deal of the life of many students,  an equally representative task would be the planning, construction and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant which serves as a primary power source for the College..While well within the US tradition of the "gentleman farmer" well-steeped in the classics,  Deep Springs College is quite a bit more than "a good place to experience life as a farmer.".Upvote.·.99.13.Related questions.What is the best way to get into Deep Springs College as a transfer?.When will women be allowed to apply to Deep Springs College?.College and Admissions: What is the average profile of admitted Deep Springs College students?.How is Deep Springs funded?.Where did you go, and what did you do after attending Deep Springs College?.How intense are the academics at Deep Springs College?.Are there any international students at Deep Springs College?.Is it good to study at Deep Springs College for a Master's?.Are there any Deep Springs alumni on Quora?.What is the professional world’s view of Deep Springs College?.Do you have any ideas on Deep Springs College?.What does it take to be accepted at Deep Springs College?.What are the requirements to be accepted into Deep Springs College?

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools..

Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Over the past 22 years he has prepared hundreds of students using TPR's proven methods. He teaches classes, is a tutor, and, for the past 16 years, has trained new teachers for TPR..Jerry works well with students across the scoring spectrum, and he has a special affinity for high scorers who want to go even higher. He attributes his success to thorough knowledge of a wide spectrum of standardized tests and his ability to relate well to students whose pursuit of higher test scores is an important part of their lives, but not their entire lives. Jerry likes to tell his students that he's the one component of the college admissions process that will make their lives easier rather than complicating them..Sara Kuperstein.Sara has been teaching and tutoring for the Princeton Review since 2012. She always excelled at taking standardized tests and was a National Merit Finalist in high school. Sara loves helping students conquer standardized tests and hates the idea of a hard-working student being denied admission due to a pointless exam. Her goal as a teacher and tutor is to provide each student with a plan for how to approach every type of question on the test so that the student feels confident and prepared when going in to take the test. In addition to teaching and tutoring, Sara also writes and edits for the Princeton Review’s books and online content..See What Our.Students Say.“I absolutely loved my teacher! She was awesome.

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools.. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to.comcom@deepsprings.edu...To make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page.here...Academics.Like the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

This is why we have thrived for over 35+ years..Amanda Nowotny.B.A. Music and Politics & Philosophy, University of Pittsburgh.Amanda began working for The Princeton Review in 2006. After earning that first certification, she caught the TPR bug and has since trained in ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, MCAT CARS, ISEE, SSAT, and College Admissions Consulting. She is also qualified to tutor select SAT Subject Tests and AP exams. Additionally, Amanda trains new ACT instructors and has contributed to content development for our GMAT and AP Human Geography materials. While laid-back and irreverent, she challenges her students to achieve their highest potential and cherishes the notion that a better test score can actually change a student’s life.
									Qualifications: Master Trainer for ACT; Tutor for SAT, ACT, SSAT, AP/Subject Tests, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT.Jerry Dresner.B.A., University of Virginia (Psychology-High Distinction), J.D., University of Virginia School of Law.Accelerated Certificate in Teaching, College of Notre Dame of Maryland.Jerry was making the transition from practicing law to teaching when he began teaching for The Princeton Review (TPR) in 1996. He then spent 21 years as a high school social studies teacher, specializing in AP U.S. History, AP Psychology, AP World History, and AP U.S. Government & Politics. Over the past 22 years he has prepared hundreds of students using TPR's proven methods. He teaches classes, is a tutor, and, for the past 16 years, has trained new teachers for TPR..Jerry works well with students across the scoring spectrum, and he has a special affinity for high scorers who want to go even higher. He attributes his success to thorough knowledge of a wide spectrum of standardized tests and his ability to relate well to students whose pursuit of higher test scores is an important part of their lives, but not their entire lives. Jerry likes to tell his students that he's the one component of the college admissions process that will make their lives easier rather than complicating them..Sara Kuperstein.Sara has been teaching and tutoring for the Princeton Review since 2012. She always excelled at taking standardized tests and was a National Merit Finalist in high school. Sara loves helping students conquer standardized tests and hates the idea of a hard-working student being denied admission due to a pointless exam. Her goal as a teacher and tutor is to provide each student with a plan for how to approach every type of question on the test so that the student feels confident and prepared when going in to take the test. In addition to teaching and tutoring, Sara also writes and edits for the Princeton Review’s books and online content..See What Our.Students Say.“I absolutely loved my teacher! She was awesome.

The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley..Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design..The three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles..Since the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin..Together with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose.The League of Nunnian Schools.. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to.comcom@deepsprings.edu...To make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page.here...Academics.Like the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected..There are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s.Ethics., Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson..The distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure..After completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago..Click.here.for more information on the Academic Pillar..Labor.In addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment..While students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility..“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we do here. Cows need to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs need to be rinsed so that they can be used for breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities seriously because there are immediate and urgent consequences if you don’t do your job well. The vast majority of my personal growth has come from a series of mistakes. You mess up, you figure out how to proceed, and you ultimately learn how to do a better job . The labor pillar gives you room to fail, and that’s crucial.” – Michael Leger, DS16 New Brunswick, Canada.Click.here.for more information on the labor pillar..STUDENT SELF-GOVERNANCE.Students at Deep Springs participate in running the college itself in ways that are not possible at larger institutions. The Student Body exists as a discrete, self-governing entity within the College, tasked with governing itself and working with the staff and faculty in the day-to-day operation of the college..The Student Body convenes at least once a week to deliberate and take action on issues concerning community life, labor, academic planning, disciplinary matters, election of  student office holders, and more. Students are elected to positions of leadership within the Student Body and the larger community. Elected positions include Student Body President; Labor Commissioner, who assigns students labor positions and is in charge of making sure the labor program runs smoothly; and Student Trustee, one of two students who sits on the Board of Trustees of the College as full voting members..Additionally, students serve on one of four standing committees..The Applications Committee.handles student admissions..The Curriculum Committee.handles faculty hiring, sets academic policy, reviews cases of academic misconduct, guides course selection and makes recommendations for faculty retention..The Review and Re-invitations Committee.reviews individual student progress throughout the year, facilitates a biannual process of written or verbal feedback between all students,.and leads the re-invitation process by which students are or aren’t re-invited for a second year.. The.Communications Committee.manages relations with the outside world, deliberating on press requests, publishing the biannual alumni newsletter and maintaining this website! Each committee is chaired by a student and meets weekly throughout the year..Since Deep Springs is only a two-year program, students do not often see the full outcomes of their decisions. But just as they are the recipients of decisions made by students before them, so they, in turn, are obligated to try to make the best choices possible for students who follow. This chain of responsibility, from one generation of students to the next, continually reinforces and reinvigorates the.gravity students at Deep Springs take in governing their college...Contact.Board of Trustees & Accreditation.Academic Calendar.Facebook.Visitation Policy.Deep Springs College.HC72 Box 45001.Dyer, NV 89010.Website design by the Deep Springs Communications Committee.comcom@deepsprings.edu.Search for:

Nunn's first projects—a hydroelectric plant in.Telluride, Colorado., and the.Olmsted Power Station.in.Provo, Utah.—served as the foundation for his inspiration to create a new type of educational institution..[3].As it became difficult to find enough engineers capable of living under rough conditions, he began schooling local men and pursued an interest in education..[4].Nunn eventually sold his industrial assets to fund the.Telluride Association., an educational trust based at.Cornell University., and the.Telluride House...[5].After becoming dissatisfied with the association's mission, he founded Deep Springs and helped in its administration until his death in 1925..[6].The establishment of Deep Springs was a reaction to what Nunn saw as a decline in academic standards in traditional American colleges..[7].His philosophy governing Deep Springs focused strictly around the pursuit of "academics, labor, and self-governance", something he dubbed the "three pillars" which supported the "whole man"..[8].The inclusion of manual labor in a college's educational program was unusual in 1917, but a number of so-called.manual labor colleges.had existed in the United States in the 19th century—including, at one time,.Oberlin College., which Nunn attended..[9].By the early 1860s, most had either closed or had abandoned their manual labor programs..[10].These pillars entailed students playing an active role in the administration of the college by laboring in the field and contributing to student meetings during committees, which Nunn believed was an effective method of producing "leaders for a democratic society"..[5].To this end, the.board of trustees., which Nunn established to preserve the college's traditions, contained one—later two—seats that were reserved for student trustees, who were elected by the.student body.and currently remain with full voice and voting rights..[11].Due to his correspondence with these early student bodies, Nunn decided the college would provide student housing and would not include a.tuition...[12].In the 1990s, the school's leadership debated transitioning the college to be.coeducational.. Whereas many women in the Telluride Association advocated for the change, a large portion of the school's alumni wished to keep its status as a men's college..[13].Though the board of Deep Springs voted against making any change in 1994, the college later accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan from Telluride under the condition that Deep Springs would begin admitting women by 2019..[14].In 2011, the college's trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees' action..[15].The challengers disputed the authority of the college's board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year..[16].[17].On April 13, 2017, the.California Court of Appeal.ruled that the college could admit women in.Hitz v. Hoekstra...[18].With the.Supreme Court of California.declining to hear an appeal,.[19].the board of trustees voted once again to admit women, with the first female students arriving in July 2018..[20].[21].Curriculum.[.edit.].Deep Springs students and staff moving cattle.Deep Springs involves students working on tasks in the nearby ranch including "cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, and fixing vehicles" with the.academic curriculum.dedicated wholly to the.liberal arts.such as.Ancient Greek., philosophy, political science, and literature..[1].Classes are taught by a long-term.faculty.—the.president.,.dean., and.chairs.of the.natural science.and.humanities.department—and a division of visiting professors and scholars which make up the short-term faculty, neither of which may hold.tenure...[22].Undergraduates work a minimum of 20 hours a week,.[23].rotating tasks while also studying for their classes..[12].Students attend classes during the morning and spend the afternoon working on the ranch..[24].Though the majority of learning is loosely regulated and done mainly through informal discussions, there are two required courses: freshman composition and public speaking..[25].After graduation, approximately two-thirds of the student body transfer to an.Ivy League.university or another similarly ranked institution,.[26].[27].with a substantial portion going on to attend.Cornell University.,.Brown University.or the.University of California, Berkeley...[12].[28].Self-governance is a critical part of the Deep Springs educational program. Students hold decision-making authority in determinations about admissions, curriculum, and faculty hiring. Every student serves on one of four standing committees during their time as a student: Applications (ApCom), Curriculum (CurCom), Communications (ComCom) or Review and Reinvitations (RCom). The Communications Committee (ComCom) was created in the early 1990s and charged with shaping the policies that define the college's relations with the world at large..[.citation needed.].Campus.[.edit.].View from main ranch to Deep Springs Valley.Deep Springs College is isolated within.Deep Springs Valley., a.geological depression.between the.White.and.Inyo.mountain ranges, with the nearest sizable town being.Bishop, California., and the closest.commercial airport.being in.Las Vegas...[23].With the college's campus consisting primarily of its 32,000-acre (13,000 ha) ranch,.[23].its physical isolation plays a central role in the educational experience. The college also contains a.bookstore.,.post office., and a.library., all maintained by students..[29].Partly due to Nunn's previous experience closing down a school in.Virginia.due to students deserting campus,.[23].the school's "isolation policy" forbids students from leaving the college's campus and prohibits the use of.alcohol...[7].Deep Springs used to have a direct telephone line crossing the White Mountains, but difficult maintenance made service unsustainable..[30].The line was replaced in the 1980s by a wireless radio link connecting to the Bishop.central office.. Because the radio signal is relayed using a repeater station high in the White Mountains, and because the first relay out of Deep Springs Valley does not have.line of sight., the system is subject to outages caused by high winds and inclement weather. Previously, the college's Internet connection was an unusually slow 14.4 kbit/s data channel.multiplexed.into the radio link. Not later than 2011, the college connected to the.internet by satellite...[31].Deep Springs has an.FM radio.-based.Voice over Internet Protocol.phone system,.[31].and.direct inward dialing...[32].A small.seismic station.exists behind the main campus, installed by the former.Soviet Union.as part of a bi-national underground nuclear test monitoring agreement..[33].Alumni.[.edit.].Despite the small number of admitted students, Deep Springs disproportionately produces members of academia with the majority of graduates going on to receive.doctorates.;.[34].these include multiple scholars, professors, authors, scientists, and.members of government.. The college's alumni have been awarded.Rhodes.and.Truman.Scholarships, three.MacArthur "genius grants"., two.Pulitzer Prizes., one.Emmy award., and one.E. O. Lawrence Award., among other honors. Prominent alumni include:.Robert B.

RPI also admits about 200 transfer students per year:.Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Admissions.It is unclear what you like about Duke (social, size, weather, program focus, etc).

I'd like to talk about my own experiences and research and give you steps to fallow, in the most.concise and honest.manner possible..Transfer admissions is way more competitive now than it was a few years ago because community college has gotten so popular.  If you look at Jennifer's link.Page on transferweb.com., most of those acceptance rates are about half what they were in 2012 now.  Georgetown accepted 7% of transfer students this year vs.  13% in 2012.  If you are serious about transferring, you need to become a master researcher and find these rates yourself..Here are some steps:.1) Meet standards.  You need to have a 3.8 gpa minimum, preferably a 4.0.  Your SAT's must be in the middle 50% range.  You must have great recommendations..Extra curricular wise 2 things:.You must be a leader.  Colleges want the next big time CEOs and Presidents to attend their college... Show you may be it and this will help a ton!.You must be a specialist.  This will make you stand out.  A specialist is someone who excels so much at one thing, you can't ignore it.  For example, a business specialist would have these extra curricular activities:.- Business club president.- internship at business xyz.- mentors other students on business.- writes business articles for the school newspaper....you get the point.2) Have a legitimate reason to transfer... I don't like my current college isn't a high quality one.  You must have reasons to transfer to a specific school for specific reasons.  For example, xyz school has a major I want to do, or location, ect..3) Figure out which college you should go to.  Take a quantitative rational approach.  To do this, get an excel sheet and list every college in the top 100 national schools, and top 30 liberal arts schools.  Then create a rankings system based on the things important to you.  If the school meets expectations in the category, make the cell green.  If it doesn't by a little bit, make it yellow, if it's almost not do-able, make it red.  Red disqualifies the college, as does 2 yellows.  You'll find your list is actually quite small, probably 10 schools.  Take your 10 school and figure out 5 that you'd like to go to and apply to them..4) Research those schools and know them in and out.  Contact them, show you really want to go..5) Write the best essay the admissions office has ever seen.  How to do it is a question in itself, so send me an A2A for that if you want to know the process..If you stand out by being a specialist and having a great essay, and you exceed all of the school's standards, you will be a very competitive applicant..Best of luck!.Upvote.·.99.28.9.3.James Leland Harp.UC Berkeley grad, Stanford alum, Harvard fellow, former professor and director.·.Author has.43.4K.answers and.46.7M.answer views.·.7y.A2A. Yes, you can apply to other universities; however, I am not sure if you will hate it any less..It would be nice if you took the time to tell me why you hate Duke. It would be extremely disappointing if you left Duke only to experience the same hatred at another university..Upvote.·.9.2.9.1.Related questions.How easy or hard is it to transfer to a top tier universities?.Has anyone transferred from a low-ranked university/college to an elite one like MIT, Stanford, etc.?.What is the best way to transfer to a top-tier university?.What should I do during college to transfer into an elite university (not Yale or Stanford level, but about top 20~30) as an undergraduate?.What is it like to transfer to an elite university from a non-elite university?.What makes Deep Springs College graduates so successful in the transfer process?

Graduates of Deep Springs College have historically been successful in the transfer process to elite colleges and universities for several reasons:.Academic Rigor:.Deep Springs College offers a demanding academic program that includes small class sizes, close interactions with faculty members, and a strong emphasis on critical thinking and writing skills. This rigorous academic environment helps students develop the intellectual abilities and work ethic necessary to succeed at top-tier institutions..Personalized Attention:.Due to the small size of Deep Springs College (typically around 26 students per class), students receive personalized attention from faculty and staff. This individualized support can help students excel academically and navigate the transfer process effectively..Leadership and Community Engagement:.Deep Springs College places a strong emphasis on leadership development, community service, and collaborative decision-making. These experiences help students develop valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by elite colleges and universities..Strong Letters of Recommendation:.Given the close relationships that students form with faculty members at Deep Springs College, students are often able to secure strong letters of recommendation that highlight their academic abilities, personal qualities, and potential for success at a four-year institution..While Deep Springs College does not have formal connections to elite colleges, the institution's reputation for academic excellence and the accomplishments of its graduates may help students stand out in the transfer process. Admissions committees at top-tier institutions often value diversity and unique educational experiences, which Deep Springs College provides..It's important to note that success in the transfer process is not solely determined by institutional connections but also by the individual student's academic performance, extracurricular involvement, essays, recommendations, and fit with the institution. Deep Springs College's distinctive educational model and the qualities it fosters in its students can certainly contribute to their success in transferring to elite colleges and universities..Upvote.·.Kenneth Thomas.Studied at.Deep Springs College.·.Author has.4.1K.answers and.5M.answer views.·.3y.I essentially concur with John Brown’s assessment..Deep Springs attendees are somewhat self-selecting for the kind of person who is an ideal candidate at other US elites: self-motivated, generally in the top 1% of applicants to elites anyway, passionately interested in various pursuits, committed to lives of service to others, filled with ambitions often far beyond the average Ivy grind..As Roman Weil has just added, the DS admissions process—.nine essays and multi-day in-person interviews—.indeed makes what the elites do for selection look like a day in the park.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance?

Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay.

The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5.
