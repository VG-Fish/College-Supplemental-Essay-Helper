Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine..Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it. Start by understanding basic circuits. Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it. This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits..After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems. Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430. I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish..But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming. You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems..Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering. LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects..Upvote.·.99.76.9.5.Lulu Liu.BS Physics 2009.·.Upvoted by.Edwin Khoo.,.worked at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.and.Benjamin Golub.,.worked at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Author has.147.answers and.680.9K.answer views.·.13y.Related.What are the best courses at MIT?.Representing physics here.  Without getting too complicated, I'll split my answer up into best for major and best for non-major categories.  The justification is that some courses are highly valuable, but rather inaccessible to most non-majors.  Others are more accessible, but struck me as perhaps not being enough of a challenge..If you're feeling up to it, or you are thinking of majoring in physics,.I would definitely recommend the following:.8.012 Physics I - This is the course that made me a physics major.

I don't know about your high school preparation but mine did not prepare me for what I saw here.   Freshman mechanics can be really unengaging.  Everything in this class, however, is designed to challenge you, to give you that awesome feeling of putting together the pieces, of discovering something, and seeing how everything is connected to everything else.  It really left an impression on me.  Your freshman year, you will have a choice between this lecture-style intro to physics and Technology Enabled Active Learning.  Please for the love of god if you have any interest in Newtonian mechanics give this class a shot..8.962 General Relativity - I took this class with Scott Hughes.  I'm pretty sure he's the only one that has taught it in recent years.  The class is grad level, so it's small and intimate.  Hughes' lectures are very well prepared, somewhat fast moving but only enough to be fully engaging and not enough to completely lose everyone in a cloud of confusion.  The subject matter is of course mind-blowing.  Differential geometry experience is good if you are coming from math, but really pretty unnecessary.  I think he asks for 8.07 because he wants you to have seen tensors before.  8.07 doesn't really go over tensors... :/.I am going to get flak for this but....8.13 Experimental Physics (Junior Lab) - I have a reason for this.  The reason is that if you want to really believe in physics, you have to take this course. I've been thinking a lot lately that this is the single class that has been most critical in shaping the way I think about science.  I think this is because my personal belief is that the most valuable aspect of any science education is not really the knowledge that you gain, not the information itself, but the judgment, what to make of that information.  What constitutes evidence?  Is this data convincing?  What does it mean to draw a conclusion?  How do you design experiments that could achieve this?  I tell you this has been useful in many many aspects of my life outside science.  This class will suck up a lot of your time though..If you find yourself pretty interested in physics, but really you have no interest in taking Junior Lab.(that's ok), here are some of the most interesting classes taught at an introductory level:.8.033 Special Relativity - Usually sophomore physics majors take this class first semester, but a good portion of the seats fill up with listeners and non-major students.  The topic, and the lecturer (Tegmark) are both pretty popular.  You will learn a lot of bizarre things about reality that you will struggle to believe in (until you take Junior Lab!).  You will end with a unit on cosmology where you will compute the age of the universe!  There will be singing and dancing!  (My year as final exam review the 2 professors composed and sang a song about everything we learned that year, there were nice powerpoint visuals, too, anyone know if they are still doing this?)..8.286 The Early Universe - Learn about the inflation theory of the universe from.Alan Guth.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth).  Though I did wish he spent more time on that than on general cosmology.  But he's not much of a self promoter.  Nice guy..12.409 Hands On Astronomy - Super laid back class.  Though that's what I hear about most classes in Course 12.  You'll probably like this class if you like going up to the roof and taking telescope pictures of stars and planets in the middle of winter.  Which I do.  Learn how to operate an 8-inch telescope.  And then you come back downstairs and drink hot chocolate while you listen to a lecture about celestial coordinate systems.  Kind of a hidden gem.  Not too many people know about it.  Basically no homework..Non-physics classes, so I don't come across as super 1-dimensional ;).21W.756 Writing and Reading Poems - Took this with Corbett.  My favorite guy in the writing department.  He'll teach to a variety of skill levels.  The class had 4 people in it.  We just all sat right in front of him and listened to him tell stories for half the class and then read our poems aloud and talked.  His syllabus is really spot on.  For new writers trying to find their style really the more constraints, the better.  A new poem/poet is introduced each week, we analyze his/her piece and then write one of our own in their style.  I wrote some real crappers but also some of my favorite pieces in that class..21W.749 Photojournalism - B.D. Colen's class.  He really has pretty high standards for his students, despite them nearly all going to MIT.  Speaking of which, folks from other schools would take buses to come take his class in the evenings.  There was a lottery in the beginning as to who would remain because he did not want a class larger than 30.  That's how popular it is, keep in mind..21M.675 Dance Theory and Composition - If you're feeling brave!! You have to dance a lot.  And in front of people.  And to live percussion and the such.  And you will be judged!  There is a big final project that you choreograph at the end that is video recorded.for eternity., and yes, you have to be in it..Also, I highly recommend taking a sailing class.  It's not for credit, but man, was it fun.  One time I capsized in front of a group of about 20 people sunbathing on the Boston side.  When I righted the dinghy with determination I got a round of applause.  I kind of miss MIT..If there is ever a topic about the worst classes I'd be happy to contribute as well..Upvote.·.99.85.9.4.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better?

all five disciplines carry out climate-related research. Potential applicants are encouraged to explore research carried out by faculty in each discipline to assess which of the five disciplines is best suited for their academic and interests. While climate students have a home discipline, they often take classes in many disciplines and carry out research with faculty across disciplines..Applicants are encouraged to contact faculty in their areas of interest..Oceans and Climate Variability:.The ocean covers 70% of the Earth’s surface and, through its exchange of heat, water and compounds with the atmosphere, the lithosphere, and the cryosphere, it plays a key role in our climate system.  The ocean also hosts a significant fraction of the Earth’s biosphere, which both responds to, and plays a role in, climate variability. Our scientists study both the role of the ocean in the climate system and the impact of climate change on the ocean. Depending on the area of interest, climate research can be undertaken within existing JP focal areas or as interdisciplinary studies across multiple areas, including the atmosphere and the cryosphere..Climate Impacts:.Climate research within the JP also spans the whole globe, from Greenland’s glaciers to tropical Pacific coral atolls, from Bhutan’s old-growth forests to the central Atlantic subtropical gyre, from salt marshes on Cape Cod to the deserts surrounding the Red Sea, from the Kuroshio western boundary current in the North Pacific to the monsoon rains in the Gangetic plain in India, from water resources in the US breadbasket to fragile ecosystems on the Antarctic Peninsula. Research topics within the Joint Program (JP) range from the reconstruction of past climate variability over the Earth’s history to understanding climate variability and change in the instrumental/historic period and in the future, from studies of the dynamics of the physical/chemical climate system to its impacts on the marine and terrestrial environment, such as the sustainability of marine ecosystems, water resources on land, melting of land and sea-ice, and ultimately human civilizations..Please see.Areas of Study.,.Courses.,.Faculty., and.Recent Dissertations and Theses.for more information about our program..(Photo provided by Matt Osman, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution).MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious.

You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month.

They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal.

Google Workspace Updates: New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents.Updates.This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers..New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents.Wednesday, April 12, 2023.Note:.This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please.see this post...What's Changing.Last year, we.announced plans to wind down Currents., to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published.detailed guidance.for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for.automated migration of Currents data.to spaces in Google Chat..We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can.export Currents data using Takeout.before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download..Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for.Google Chat., so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:.This month, we’re enabling.new ways for organizations to share information.across the enterprise with.announcements in Google Chat.. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain..Announcements in Google Chat.Managing space membership with Google Groups.We’ve already rolled out.new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging.such as.in-line threading.to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and.custom emojis.to enable fun, personal expression..In-line threaded conversations.Discover and join communities with up to 8,000 members.We’ve also made it easier for individuals to.discover and join communities of shared interest.. By.searching in Gmail., users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to.invite others to join.via link. Last year, we increased.the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members., and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year..A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join..As communities grow, it’s essential to provide.tools for content moderation and data management.. Last year, we introduced.space managers., a community lead with.abilities.to.moderate conversation.and.manage membership., and last year at NEXT, we rolled out.data loss prevention.(DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat..Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through.integrations with essential third-party apps.such as.Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty.,.Zendesk and Salesforce.. Many organizations have.built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools., and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year..For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year..Who's impacted.Admins and end users.Why it’s important.The transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today.

The cruise is operated by.Sea Education Association.utilizing SEA's sailing school vessel (SSV).Corwith Cramer...The cruise is named in honor of Jake Peirson who worked at WHOI from 1967 to 1996 serving as Assistant Dean and Associate Dean/Registrar always being a champion for the education programs, especially the MIT-WHOI Joint Program.  After his retirement from WHOI's Academic Programs Office, Jake took on the role of Executive Director of the Alumni Association..On the cruise, students will gain practical experience in oceanographic research as they investigate biological, chemical, physical and geological characteristics of the marine environment along the cruise track.  As a Coast Guard recognized SSV-sailing school vessel, cruise participants not only have the opportunity, but are needed to function as active crew members, thus contributing to most aspects of ship operation.  Sail handling, navigation, collection and analysis of oceanographic samples, as well as daily ship cleaning and maintenance are necessary aspects of shipboard life. The cruise is also an opportunity for the students to bond with the classmates with whom they will study, work alongside, and commiserate for the next five or so years..The cruise is offered initially to first-year students, and if berths remain available, they are offered to current students who had not yet had the chance to participate. From past participants:."The cruise was such a good way to meet everyone - not only because you have the   time,  but because you are also working alongside each other as a team, either doing science or hoisting sails."."On this cruise we also had a task to make a "water retrieval device" from stuff around us... Our team won with the IPFRASWTAS (Inflatable Puffer Fish for Retrieval and Analysis of Sea Water Temperature And Salinity) device."."...Atop the second platform, I ventured further to the topmost ratlin, shaken slightly by wind, not frightened, but satisfied with that limit.".Related Files.Education and Science: A Scientist's Presentation.A PowerPoint Presentation by Dr. Glen Gawarkiewicz about the science on the Jake Pierson SEA Cruise..Read More.Images from the 2018 Jake Peirson Summer Sail.Read More.Images from the 2013 Jake Peirson Summer Sail.Read More.Images from the 2008 Jake Peirson Summer Sail.MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

and eventually embark on thesis research in a wide variety of fields of study. The program is flexible, with an emphasis on reaching academic milestones rather than on the path taken..1st summer.Participating in the summer program before the first year is strongly recommended. Students start with the annual.Jake Peirson Summer Cruise.. Then students undertake a research project, attend seminars, and meet with their academic advisory committee to arrange a course of study for the first year..1st and 2nd years.Students work on obtaining general knowledge of the field of marine chemistry and geochemistry, specific knowledge in the area of their thesis research, and research experience. See.Curriculum.for more details..Along with their research advisors and academic advisory committee, they set a course of study, including class work, independent study, and perhaps tutorials with faculty members to obtain the breadth and depth of knowledge needed to become a productive researcher..Students carry out independent research throughout their first two years, though the level of research effort is expected to vary through the year because course work takes up most of the students' time during the academic semesters. The breadth of research experiences varies from student to student, but all are encouraged to undertake research in an area that is distinct from their expected thesis area. Most students begin preliminary research in their thesis area during the second year..General exams.The general exams, taken during the spring and summer of the second year, are designed to evaluate:.The student's grasp of material covered in the core curriculum and other courses specific to the student's research interests as well as the ability to synthesize material from different sources.The student's ability to carry out and present an independent research project..Students also present and defend a thesis proposal..3rd through 5th years.Students carry out thesis research under the supervision of a thesis advisor and thesis committee. They are expected to demonstrate satisfactory progress through thesis committee meetings and presentations at MIT and WHOI as well as at national and international meetings. At the end of the fifth year, each student presents and defends a Ph.D. thesis that represents a significant contribution to his or her area of study..JCCO-Handbook.(pdf).For more information regarding the field of Chemical Oceanography and its requirements, please refer to the discipline's handbook..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Each student formulates a program of studies with the assistance of academic advisors drawn from both MIT and WHOI. The recommended course load is four per semester..Students are expected to attend research seminars and to complete widespread independent reading of the literature..Core Courses.There are 3 requirements:.1) Geological Oceanography: This course provides a high level survey of a broad range of active science topics in Geological Oceanography including solid-earth geophysics, geochemistry, sedimentology and stratigraphy, coastal processes, and climate..2) Presenting Scientific Research: This seminar is designed to develop the skills that students will need to present their research to others; it includes critiques of oral presentations, preparation of abstracts, discussions of graphic materials, and creation of scientific posters. Students normally take the seminar in one or both of the first two years..3) A data analysis class: A data analysis class suited to the student's research interests, at either MIT or WHOI..Electives.Students typically choose additional courses from those offered at WHOI and at MIT by the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. Many students take classes in other departments as well because of research interests that lie at the interface of two disciplines. For more complete information on course offerings, see the.MIT catalogue.. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-register at Harvard, Brown, or in the Boston University Marine Program..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

The Joint Program is organized within five disciplines (described below), each administered by a Joint Committee consisting of MIT and WHOI faculty members..The Joint Program offers a master’s degree program for U.S. Naval Officers, and more than 85 officers have received this degree dating back to the first award in 1970. With the exception of the U.S. Naval Officers program, students are not admitted to the Joint Program for a Master’s degree. However, a Master’s degree can be awarded in all programs on the way to a doctoral degree or as a terminal degree..The Joint Program is an ocean science program in the broadest sense. Student research projects extend beyond ocean science into earth science, hydrology, glaciology, marine conservation, and environmental chemistry, to name a few. Coursework in marine policy is not mandated by any of the Joint Committees, although there are opportunities to take policy courses at MIT and Harvard. In addition, WHOI has a Marine Policy Center, and its faculty lead informal seminars on marine policy as well as serve on thesis committees..Joint Program students have access to courses, programs and resources at one of the top oceanographic research institutions in the world (WHOI), one of the top research universities in the world (MIT), and they have the opportunity to take courses at Harvard. In addition to seminars and lectures by visiting scientists from all over the world, students can expand their intellectual horizons by taking courses or participating in programs well outside their main area of focus..The Joint Program is committed to providing five years of tuition and stipend support to every student who is admitted, assuming satisfactory progress in the program. The Joint Program also has funds to help students attend scientific meetings, conferences, and special courses and to support student research. The Joint Program provides transportation options between the two campuses as well as housing at MIT and at WHOI for qualified students..Organization: JP Structure and Interdisciplinary Research.JP Disciplines and Departmental Structure:.Each Joint Program student is associated with one primary discipline and is a member of one MIT Department and one WHOI Department. This structure allows each student to have a "home base" but also provides flexibility to support interdisciplinary research (described below).JP Discipline.MIT Department.WHOI Department.Applied Ocean Science and Engineering (AOSE).Aeronautics and Astronautics (Aero-Astro), Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), OR Mechanical Engineering (MechE).Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering (AOP&E).Biological Oceanography (BO).Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); Biology; OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Biology.Chemical Oceanography (CO).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry (MC&G).Marine Geology and Geophysics (MG&G).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Geology and Geophysics (G&G).Physical Oceanography (PO).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).Physical Oceanography (PO).Interdisciplinary Research:.Many students conduct interdisciplinary research; common interdisciplinary themes include climate science and coastal processes. The Joint Program leadership works to support and accommodate students with interdisciplinary interests (see.interdisciplinary statement and thesis examples.). Thesis committees frequently include faculty members from multiple disciplines, such as biologists and engineers, chemists and geologists, or physical oceanographers and biologists ..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

I know this because I was there (Class of 1960)..So, when Mechatronics develops into a truly separate engineering discipline, re-post this Question..And before someone thinks of me as being opposed to progress, a side comment. The MIT Dept of Aero & Astro celebrates THREE birthdays. The first MIT Degree granted in Aeronautical Engineering was before WW I (1914 IIRC). The Aero Dept achieved total separation from the ME Dept and became a totally separate engineering discipline just before WW II (1940 IIRC). I attended the special Celebration Dinner commemorating both events. The THIRD BIRTHDAY? The Class of 1960 was the first anywhere in the world to receive degrees in Astronautics with the change of the Department Name to Dept of Aeronautics & Astroncomplex..So, I feel that RIGHT NOW Mechatronics is still a “buzz-word.” For now, completing Subjects in ME, EE, and whatever else is appropriate is adequate PROVIDED that the Faculty teaches these areas in a unified manner….. which is what the MIT Faculty has done for decades..Upvote.·.9.5.Tom Stagliano.Senior Aerospace Engineer (studied at MIT).·.Author has.52.3K.answers and.185.1M.answer views.·.6y.Related.Does MIT offer mechatronics as a course?.No. MIT does not offer a specific program in Mechatronics..One does Not need a specific program in Mechatronics or any niche area as an undergraduate at MIT.

The good part — most of them are young — and the better part — they know their thing (except 2–3 teachers) — and the best part — all of them come from different disciplines. While there are a few teachers you might not like, there are​ also a few teachers you might fall in love with (I actually have with one, she's too good… uh, never mind!). Then most of them are always working on some project and you can work under them, or you might have your own project idea and you can ask some tecaher to help with that..And, since it's an emerging field in India, they are trying their best to give students the required exposure. This brings us to the labs which have been setup with equipments from the companies like Bosch Rexroth, ABB and Siemens. We have the following labs — PLC, Sensorics, Mechatronics, Hydraulics & Pneumatics, Robotics and Drives & Control. The Robotics Lab has ABB's 6-axis IRB robot, Drives & Control Lab has PLCs and Electric Drives provided by Bosch & the Mechatronics Lab consists of a complete miniature Modular Production System with 5 stations. And, if it makes it more likeable, they are all air-conditioned :).In spite of all these positive aspects, it all gets narrowed down to Mechatronics being not so popular in India and India being not much into automation. And that, my friend, affects the placements. The companies like Tata are specifically told to recruit from the core branches like Mechanical. The highest package goes around 7–8 Lacs for Mechatronics in Manipal.

with applied research and engineering design of systems for the exploration, measurement, mapping, prediction, and beneficial use of the oceans..From theory to application.In the Joint Program, knowledge acquired in the classroom can be immediately applied to seagoing research on oceanic processes and engineering. For example, AOSE students:.Take courses on information theory and apply that theory to quantify the information content of whale sounds..Attend lectures on the control of dynamic systems while applying advanced control concepts to the navigation and maneuvering of autonomous underwater vehicles..Take theoretical courses on oceanic processes while participating in field programs designed to quantify ocean variables that have never before been measured..Breadth of opportunity.The educational opportunities in AOSE in the Joint Program are unparalleled in breadth and depth. Four MIT departments—Civil Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Aeronautics and Astronautics—join the WHOI department of Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering in the Joint Program discipline of AOSE..The diverse faculty in these departments provide a wide range of course offerings in several disciplines as well as a correspondingly wide range of research opportunities for graduate students. For example, Joint Program research on acoustics ranges from using sound for the quantification of the smallest scales of oceanic salinity variations to understanding the bewildering physics of sound transmission across the Pacific. Research on physical-biological interactions ranges from elucidating the mechanics of squid propulsion to understanding the processes that lead to the harmful algal blooms ("red tides") that affect human health. Research on signal processing ranges from obtaining holographic images of marine microorganisms to developing technologies for obtaining quantitative images of undersea archaeological sites..Looking forward.Finally, graduate education in AOSE in the Joint Program opens doors. Graduates of this program have pursued a variety of ocean-related careers in academia, industry, and government. In addition, because of the rigor and generality of the educational program and the intellectual training obtained from the research experience, graduates of this program have successfully pursued a variety of non-ocean-related careers..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

About 71% of the earth is covered by water, mostly in seas and oceans. Observation of marine life and exploration of unknown environments with minimal disturbance can help us better understand the habitat we are living in. Moreover, we, humans, even can’t live without clean water. Thus, improving the working condition and health of the water supply pipe system is the underlying task humans have to face. One problem is in open water, while the other is in a confined pipe space. But these two researches are quite relevant inherently and they both outline our contributions in soft materials, embedded instrumentation, control theory, and design methodologies..A. Robotic technologies for smart pipes, in-pipe inspection and repairs.A.1 Specific Application.The world has a major issue with the basis of life, water. By 2025, the United Nations predicts that nearly two billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity. Furthermore, there are added stresses. They include (i) effects of climate change, (ii) rising demand for water by many communities,(iii) water pipe leakage, (iv) inefficient water management, and (v) inefficient water utilization. Around the world, about 25-30% of fresh and clean water is leaked into the ground annually during distribution. In developing countries, water loss rates can be more than 40%. In addition, results of such water leaks can result in property damage, caving of streets and foundations, and water contamination. Inefficiency of water management amplifies losses through pipe leakages. Thus, reducing the non-revenue water to an acceptable level is crucial. Different sectors rely on water and are significantly affected by these issues. They include energy utility, agriculture, commercial, manufacturing industries in addition to residential. Such pipe leakage problems happen also in the gas distribution industry. For example, the state of Massachusetts in the US, loses more than 18% of the distributed natural gas due to the 3000 leaks that take place every year. Therefore, reliable and effective technologies must be developed and deployed to ensure the sustainability of water supply..A.2 Innovative, outstanding and essential.Our efforts have focused on the development of advanced robotic technologies for pipes, pipe inspection and repairs. Our approach targets two objectives:.(i).development of smart pipes and.(ii).in-pipe robots. Smart pipes are pipes that are instrumented, equipped with computing and communication capabilities. They gather and transmit information that includes continuous health monitoring and pipe integrity, product flow inside the pipe, the exact location of needed inspection, maintenance or repair, etc. Innovative multi-layer sensors with finely tuned material properties within each layer are developed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. A novel energy harvester adopting magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is developed to power low-power sensor nodes. In-pipe robots, on the other hand, are specialized robots designed to maneuver inside a pipe and conduct various tasks. This is different from diagnosing or repairing water distribution pipes from outside of the pipe. State-of-the-art rehabilitation techniques require the use of heavy machinery and human labor. Such practices are time-consuming, expensive, and inefficient, requiring service interruption. Several advantages are thus inherent to in-pipe robots. For example, the internal surface of pipes is generally more ‘informative’ than the external surface. Corrosion, the number one reason for pipe outbreaks, takes place more frequently inside the pipes than outside. Detecting or analyzing the by-product of pipe corrosion, such as tubercles, with an in-pipe robot, can lead to more certain indicators of a pipe defect, even before the defect actually takes place. We successfully developed both passive and active robots for diversified tasks in the pipe. The active robots we designed to feature outperforming maneuverability, which is superior within the confined pipe space..A.3 Specific application: describe its tangible results and reasons for its significance.A series of in-pipe robotic solutions were developed. The development of such specialized robots and their associated technologies started in 2008. These include an in-pipe locomotion robot, an in-pipe inspection robot, an in-pipe rehabilitation robot, an in-pipe energy harvester, on-board pipe inspection sensors, underground communication networks, and underground path planning schemes of robot swarms. The inspection robot, rehabilitation robot, and energy harvester are three outstanding examples that present tangible advancements in our research. In brief, our customized pipe-profile sensor and off-line localization algorithms, the inspection robot portrays the in-pipe profile accurately as it moves along the pipe, including both pipe obstructions and the presence of leaks. Operators can then decide if a pipe segment requires an imminent repair or if the condition falls under operating standards. With this predictive capability, the water department is able to perform pipe rehabilitation before damage takes place, preventing major expenses, service disruptions and, and more importantly, ensuring the safety and health of citizens. Upon successful identification of(potential) pipe-related hazards, the next step is to rehabilitate the defect area. Consumer health and safety are of prime importance..For example, here is an in-pipe robot that rehabilitates the pipe, contains the contamination while maintaining water service. Maintaining water service and water quality is desirable by customers and water departments. Manual pipe rehabilitation is also an abundant source for pipeline contamination, with corrosion in particular. The MRL rehabilitation robot aims at ameliorating pollution generated from the rehabilitation operation. It features a specialized robot configuration and a soft end effector to contain as much operational waste as possible. The advantage is obvious. By accessing the defect location from the inside, operators no longer have to conduct excessive digging and interrupt service. In addition, rehabilitation operations are far more efficient. In the case of traditional rehabilitation, the entire pipe section has to be replaced, even when the defect area is small. Alternatively, the in-pipe rehabilitation robot can localize the operation in this minimal area. Furthermore, robotic rehabilitation avoids the necessity to open-cut the pipe segment. This provides remarkable potentials that rehabilitation could be done even without shutting down the water distribution service..Designing and instrumenting auxiliary devices for in-pipe operation is a critical step towards the entire in-pipe industry. One outstanding example is our in-pipe energy harvester. We developed magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)based energy harvesters for low-power instrumentation. This innovative solution uses the water flow in the pipe to generate electrical power. Unlike traditional energy harvesters utilizing principles of electromagnetics, piezoelectricity, and solar energy conversion, the MHD energy harvester features a dramatic increase in robustness. This is essential in this application because of the ultra-long lifetime requirement of the pipe system. After careful analysis and design, our prototype MHD energy harvester demonstrates the potential to meet the power requirements of a sensor node with microcontrollers, sensors, communication, and data storage. This development provides a new perspective on energy harvesting and great confidence in self-contained instrumentation in the next generation of smart pipes..Some other featured works are also noteworthy as important parts for the whole system to work. Sensing the robots location via GPS or remote sensors requires greater power and relies on certain ground properties. Thus we set out to localize the robot using only the onboard sensors which are an IMU, gyro, and the leak sensors. Through pipe joint measurement and the extended Kalman filter simulations show the tracking error is about 0.5% of the total distance of the robotic inspection. To better differentiate leaks from pipe joints and obstacles, sensors were arranged in a particular way to decouple the four deformation modes of the material: uniaxial tension, bending, compressive pressure, and torsion..A.4 Playing an important role in human life.These developments have an important role in human life. Around 700 million people are suffering from water scarcity. The problem affects 43 counties from every continent on the earth. However, water scarcity is getting worse and worse. By 2025, absolute water scarcity will happen in the counties and regions where 1.8 billion people will be living. Two third of the global population will need to face stressed water conditions. And this ratio will increase to half by 2030. Even in regions with sufficient water supply, water quality is still a big concern. WHO reported that more than 3.4 million people are killed by water-related diseases around the world, making it the leading cause of disease and death. The smart pipes and in-pipe robots developed by us can effectively ameliorate the problem by monitoring and repairing the leak to make the utmost of the limited clean water supply, and monitoring water contamination in multiple forms to increase the water quality and control disease spread. Even in countries with sufficient and hygienic water supply, our research can further improve the efficiency of water utilization, boosting the development of industrial production and improvement of human life by lowering the cost of water supply..B. Marine Robotics.B.1 Specific Application: Monitoring and predicting ocean health and marine life is crucial to the health of our planet. Conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet..As the saying goes Ocean health is our health..Covering more than 70% of the surface of our planet, oceans are the goldmines of natural resources. As technology advances, so does our step towards deep water. Underwater operations, such as oil well exploration, oil-spill monitoring, tactical reconnaissance involve strategic competitions between governments. With hydrologic monitoring of the ocean, such as the salinity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen, scientists are able to make predictions of the future states of various species. On the other hand, keeping track of the biological information of aqua-lives is also an accurate probe for scientists to observe the health of the ocean, or even, the health of our planet.  [Ocean health to our health].Even more resourceful and inspirational than the ocean is natural habitats in the ocean. For example, blue-fin tuna can reach a speed of ~74km/h, an extremely high speed even compared to modern ships that are proposed by steam or nuclear engines. The stamina of Atlantic salmon allows them to travel more than 10,000km before coming back home. How the naturally-evolved aqua-lives achieve such impressive engineering performances are of significant research value. To study the natural state of aqua-lives and protect our precious ocean, we, as observers, have to blend into the background. Looking and swimming like a fish is our solution..B.2 Innovative, outstanding and essential.Our work focused on the development of biomimetic robots for monitoring ocean health and marine life in their natural state. The MRL is the first to apply and formalize the basic principles of the underactuated soft body approach to fish-like robots..The approach relies on two principles: using soft bodies instead of traditional stiff mechanisms, and allowing passive mechanism dynamics to achieve target motions. With analytical modeling of desired swimming motion and combining it with the viscoelastic dynamics of the soft body in fluid, we can optimize the geometrical and material properties, such as the modulus of soft material and viscosity distribution of the fish body, and prescribe the actuation distribution, including actuator number, locations, magnitude, and frequency. Our design methodology is universal. We successfully applied the design to carangiform and thunniform-like bodies and later transferred to much more complex body forms such as batoid-like robots, like stingrays, and salamander bodies. Our robot takes full advantage of soft materials and swimming posture of fish, allowing us to significantly reduce the mechanical complexity of the robot while generating a more natural motion than previously proposed robots. Our research work also pioneered in characterization of and fabrication with soft materials like silicone rubber..B.3 Specific application.A diversity of robotic fish were developed and field-tested..With our universal design methodology described above, we were able to propose and implement soft robotic fish of various body shapes. In one of our research articles, we detailed the development of a carangiform fish. Despite the kinematic and dynamic equations, we also set up a constrained optimization problem, such as minimizing the number of actuators, actuation amplitude or energy consumption. The finalized design is in a form of servo-actuated rigid plate, embodied in a viscoelastic body. To handle the fabrication of this unique design, we invented a sequential molding practice. The prototyped soft robotic fish was experimented in a laboratory environment. Our data acquisition system tracks the trajectories of multiple points on the robot’s body, collects the thrust, velocity, and visualizes the vortex flow at the vicinity of the fish. Additionally, we generalize the work to fish with even more complex geometries. One of our famous works is the stingray prototype. We conducted a field test with the stingray robot in Singapore..B.4 Playing an important role in human life.These developments have an important role in human life..Our development in bio-inspired soft robotic fish plays an important role in human life. Scientists and engineers can now study and observe marine lives more intimately and quietly than ever before. Potentially, with our naturally-motioned robots, we will be able to manipulate the behavior of marine lives, or even perform in a leadership role. Such applications include steering fish away from environmental disaster, or balancing regional populations of various species. From an engineering point of view, the underactuated natural and its related control, fabrication, and mechanical design are inspirational to related researches. The efficient propulsion methodology of fish and unique usage of soft material are also heuristics to other marine robot locomotions or under-water vehicle designs. It motivated one of the MRL in-pipe locomotion robots in a later study..C. Influence of the work.:.C.1 important scientific contributions and advancement of knowledge.Our work has resulted in important scientific contributions...As a result, in the journey of this project till now, we have published 50 papers and disclosed 18 patents. The papers and patents range from sensor design and analysis, robot design, localization, communication, network management, and system integration. We also composed one book comprehensively covering not only the locomotion, actuation, design, soft material, and control, but also robotic fish collaboration and robot fish in animal behavioral studies. All these publications contribute cutting edge knowledge to academia and industry and provide priceless experience for enthusiasts working on soft materials, robotics, mechatronics, fluid-structure-interaction, and artificial intelligence. Dr. You Wu, the main developer of the leak detection soft robot, is honored with the following awards:.1) 2017 MIT Water Innovation Prize, this a startup competition focused on water innovation that awards up to $30K in innovation grants annually to student-led teams..2) 2017 Infy maker Award by Infosys Foundation, Infy Maker Awards is a competition hosted by Infosys Foundation USA..Environmental Media Association, 2018, The Environmental Media Association (EMA) is dedicated to the mission of promoting environmental progress and bring the planet’s most pressing issues to the forefront..3) Future Innovator Award, 2018 James Dyson Award, and many others..4) Forbes 30 Under 30, one of four MIT students in 2018 to receive this title even before his graduation..In addition to the awards, our in-pipe leak detection robots were featured on the Business Insider, Quartz, the MIT News for twice, and several other reputational press in the US. Our marine robot is reported by the discovery channel, CNN, and MIT news..Our research has advanced the frontiers of knowledge..Besides the key technologies we developed during the journey, we proposed several methodologies for sensors, soft material modelings, design, robotics, and several other fields. With these methodologies and experience, we promote our research faster and faster. For example, in the development of the marine robot,.we identified and summarized a five-step design methodology for soft robotic fish. And in most of our researches, we combine theoretical analysis, modeling, numerical simulation, fast prototyping, and testing..C.2 Our work had a great impact.After successful development in the lab phase, we gradually ramped up our field test, industrial collaboration, and commercialization to pursue a greater impact. We first collaborated with Singapore on the robot fish. Later, we collaborated with Saudi Arabia to perform the test of our leak detection soft robot in a well-established above-ground pipe system. The results are promising that even premature leaks with a small flow volume can be distinguished and trigger the alarm. After that, we were invited by the water authorities of Cambridge, Virginia, Brazil, and the UK to perform field tests in real pipe systems that supply water to households. The results are satisfying. Several leaks were detected successfully, and the water authorities avoided the huge economic loss and potential service interruption. With these field tests, the adaptability of the robot to various working conditions, pipe materials, pipe sizes, and flow volumes is demonstrated. With the experience of the successful field tests, a startup called watchtower is launched by Dr. You Wu, who graduated from MRL..When working on the problem, we bear in mind that generality is also a top priority besides efficacy. Most principles we investigate and dive into are generic. Thus the technologies and breakthrough we contributed can also be applied to some other industries with similar problems. For example, Massachusetts in the US loses about $100M per year due to the natural gas leak. The petrochemical companies, which rely heavily on pipe systems to deliver the material and products, also encounter the similar problems of a pipe leak, pipe burst, and pipe corrosion. The leak detection sensors sense the pressure gradient around the leaks, which is a common phenomenon for fluid with high pressure inside an enclosed space. The seal and machinery cleaning mechanisms are also generic for hard surfaces. Thus adopting these technologies in other industries is a pushover. The generic solutions to our research make our innovation much more impactful..Publications.2019.15..You Wu; Elizabeth Mittmann; Crystal Winston; Kamal Youcef-Toumi.A Practical Minimalism Approach to In-pipe Robot Localization.Proceedings Article.In:.2019 American Control Conference (ACC),.pp. 3180-3187,.IEEE.IEEE,.2019.,.ISBN: 978-1-5386-7926-5...Abstract.|.Links.|.BibTeX.@inproceedings{MRL_WDP_Pipe_Robot_Localization,.title = {A Practical Minimalism Approach to In-pipe Robot Localization},.author = {You Wu and Elizabeth Mittmann and Crystal Winston and Kamal Youcef-Toumi},.url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8814648},.doi = {10.23919/ACC.2019.8814648},.isbn = {978-1-5386-7926-5},.year  = {2019},.date = {2019-08-19},.booktitle = {2019 American Control Conference (ACC)},.pages = {3180-3187},.publisher = {IEEE},.organization = {IEEE},.abstract = {Water pipe leakage is a common and significant problem around the world.

This method takes into account characteristics of the wireless channels, energy consumption, pipeline coverage requirements, and SN's transmission power levels. The paper provides a path loss model for radio propagation over multiple transmission media and an algorithm for optimization of RN placement and SN's transmission power. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed framework..Close.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261282962_Channel-Aware_Relay_Node_Plac[...].doi:10.1109/TWC.2014.2314120.Close.2013.8..Apoorva Santhosh; Amro M Farid; Kamal Youcef-Toumi.Design and Evaluation of an In-Pipe Leak Detection Sensing Technique Based on Force Transduction.Proceedings Article.In:.ASME 2012 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,.IEEE.IEEE,.2013.,.ISBN: 978-0-7918-4520-2...Abstract.|.Links.|.BibTeX.@inproceedings{MRL_WDP_Force_Transduction_Leaking,.title = {Design and Evaluation of an In-Pipe Leak Detection Sensing Technique Based on Force Transduction},.author = {Apoorva Santhosh and Amro M Farid and Kamal Youcef-Toumi},.url = {https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings/IMECE2012/45202/489/254570},.doi = {10.1115/IMECE2012-87493},.isbn = {978-0-7918-4520-2},.year  = {2013},.date = {2013-10-08},.booktitle = {ASME 2012 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition},.publisher = {IEEE},.organization = {IEEE},.abstract = {Leakage is the major factor for unaccounted fluid losses in almost every pipe network.

Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine..Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it. Start by understanding basic circuits. Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it. This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits..After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems. Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430. I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish..But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming. You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems..Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering. LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects..Upvote.·.99.76.9.5.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify.

It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors..But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different..As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others..MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted..If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work..And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth..I hope this helps..Upvote.·.2.7K.2.7K.99.82.99.58.Promoted by Betterbuck.Anthony Madden.Writer for Betterbuck.·.Updated Apr 26.What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?.Where do I start?.I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits.

Not paying off credit card debt..Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt..But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (.National Debt Relief., for example) are willing to help you with your debt..Here’s how it typically works:.You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc. combined)..A company like.National Debt Relief.(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc. to try and reduce your debt..A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe. Here’s an example from.NDR.’s site:.*E.g. Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR..If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so..Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate., if you’re interested..See if you qualify for debt relief..2. Not getting a financial advisor..99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake..Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time..People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year.(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time..But more important:.a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of.If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like.WiserAdvisor.) and find somebody near you that has good reviews..Or if you want something easier,.here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs..3. Not using an ad blocker..If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am.begging.you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life..A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet..No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible..Most people I know use Total Adblock (.link here.) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options..Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice..Here’s a link to Total Adblock., if you’re interested..4. Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year..The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance..Check out a site like.Coverage.com.to compare the best car insurance options available..Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today..See how much you could save..5. Getting price gouged on the internet..You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere..Big stores like Amazon know that.no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites., so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices..I typically.hate.browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have.Capital One Shopping.installed yet, do yourself a favor and.grab it...Here’s what I mean:.I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back. Amazon’s price was $95..(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example).That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)..It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once..Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping., if you want..6. Not getting paid for your opinions..As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)..I usually use Branded Surveys (.link here.). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV..Here's the form I used to sign up.- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops..7. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)..It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)..Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (.Ark7.is one of our favorites)..They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account..It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)..If you’re interested,.take a look at Ark7’s properties here..8. Not getting paid for your screentime..There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)..I typically use.TesterUp., but there are others too. It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you. I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly..Here’s a link to the app..Hope that helps someone!.Upvote.·.5.9K.5.9K.999.268.999.141.Related questions.How is mechatronics at MIT?.Does MIT offer mechatronics as a course?.Why do universities like Stanford and MIT not have majors in mechatronics?.What Master programs can a mechatronics student go for?.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.Is it possible to get mechatronics in MIT at a rank of 25k?.How do I prepare for MS in mechatronics?.Is mechatronics course well structured in MIT, Manipal?.How do I get into MIT for MS in mechatronics?.Is an M.S. in mechatronics available in the USA?.What can I get a Master's in mechatronics in the United States?.What should I do after a B.Tech in mechatronics at MIT?.I am an mechatronics undergrad student.Can I get a MS in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence?

Chemical oceanographers examine vast ranges of time and space scales....From molecular level to global in space.From fractions of a second to billions of years in time.Interdisciplinary focus.Besides addressing purely geochemical issues, chemical oceanographers work at the boundaries between chemistry and biology, geology and physics. There they apply their efforts to a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary challenges..Climate change.Human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and agriculture, release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases that influence climate into the atmosphere. As the atmospheric carbon dioxide level rises, both scientific and societal concerns grow over potential greenhouse warming and climate change. An important fraction of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activities ends up in the ocean; without the oceans, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would be even higher than they are today. Much research in chemical oceanography focuses on quantifying the ocean's rate of uptake of carbon dioxide and understanding the biological pump by which the carbon dioxide that enters the surface ocean is transferred to deep waters and sediments, to be sequestered from the atmosphere for millennia..Some focal points of current research at WHOI and MIT are:.Applying new physical and chemical measurements to the study of the air-sea boundary layer.The result? Direct gas exchange estimates and new information on boundary layer properties that can be used by modelers to apply satellite-based measurements to the determination of ocean-wide air-sea gas exchange..Developing chemical and molecular techniques for understanding the controls on the photosynthetic activities of organisms living in the surface ocean.These developments are coupled to the continual improvement of instruments that, when mounted on floating buoys, can make continuous, at-sea measurements..Improving and deploying instruments to measure the rain of particles from the surface to the deep ocean and to understand the processes that alter the particles during their transit.These efforts have led to improvements in sediment traps so they can capture representative samples of falling particles and to the development of in situ pumps to capture suspended particles..Incorporating new chemical sensors and new technologies into instruments designed to sample marine sediments and to measure the composition of the waters contained in them.These developments are driven by an increasing recognition that sampling of sedimentary pore waters must be carried out in situ, on the sea floor—a requirement that challenges even the most innovative engineers..Understanding past, abrupt climate change can provide key insights into what may await us in the future.Scientists at WHOI and MIT are developing tools for investigating past changes. Organic geochemists exploit knowledge of specific biochemical pathways and advances in analytical instrumentation to develop chemical and isotopic tracers of biogeochemical processes and seawater characteristics that have changed over time.New developments in mass spectrometry are allowing more types of measurements on more types of samples than ever before, thereby helping investigators to continually broaden the scope of the study of past climate change..Tracing the pathways of anthropogenic emissions through the oceans (for example, bomb fallout tritium,carbon-14, and plutonium, Chernobyl and Fukushima radionuclides, anthropogenic lead and mercury, and organic pollutants such as PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)As well as establishing the anthropogenic footprint upon the ocean, these studies help us to estimate transport times and mechanisms that move these substances through the ocean..Connecting earth to sea.The organic and inorganic chemistry of seawater and marine sediments cannot be isolated from processes on land and in the earth's crust beneath the ocean. As a result, there is a strong solid earth geochemistry component to research at WHOI and MIT..Extensive sampling, both on land and beneath the sea, sophisticated laboratory experiments at in situ temperatures and pressures, and thermodynamic modeling are some of the techniques that are coupled with the wide array of state-of-the-art analytical instruments available at WHOI for the study of solid earth processes..Studies are underway to understand the ways in which continental weathering influence the composition of river water and seawater, to evaluate the effect of undersea hydrothermal activity on the composition of seawater and oceanic crust, and to reconstruct paleo-environmental conditions on land and in the sea..Sampling and measuring.All work in chemical oceanography at MIT and WHOI is driven by the goals of collecting the best samples and making the best measurements possible, using and sometimes leading the development of the latest sampling and analytical tools..To achieve these goals, you might find yourself....Elbow-deep in a nitrogen-filled glove bag, sampling sediments for organic or inorganic contaminants.Wading in coastal waters to measure exchanges between land and ocean via groundwater flow.Deploying instruments and making measurements on a rolling ship at sea.Exploring hydrothermal vents in a submersible.Sampling rocks in Antarctica, armed with a hammer and a backpack.The range of research opportunities open to you in chemical oceanography in the WHOI-MIT Joint Program is limited only by your imagination..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Maybe you can take 2 sports and practice your hobbies to the highest level possible, work for charitable Programs,make your resume blossom with extra curriculars..The 2nd part is that you need to excel in academics too, since you want to work on Mechatronics for masters, you need to excel in working on any type of embedded systems and microprocessors, do some online courses from Coursera or edx, then do some internships. Whatever you do, defend yourself with a certification, that will help you in the long run..Every day every hour your, turn your pain into power. I hope we meet there as it says dream too.

responsible development of products, processes, and power, at scales ranging from molecules to large and complex systems. Mechanical engineering principles and skills are involved at some stage during the conception, design, development, and manufacture of every human-made object with moving parts. Many innovations crucial to our future will have their roots in the world of mass, motion, forces, and energy—the world of mechanical engineers..Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest and most versatile of the engineering professions. This is reflected in the portfolio of current activities in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE), one that has widened rapidly in the past decade. Today, our faculty are involved in a wide range of projects, including designing tough hydrogels, using nanostructured surfaces for clean water and thermal management of microelectronics, developing efficient methods for robust design, the building of robotics for land and underwater exploration, creating optimization methods that autonomously generate decision-making strategies, developing driverless cars, inventing cost-effective photovoltaic cells, developing thermal and electrical energy storage systems, using acoustics to explore the ocean of one of Jupiter's moons, studying the biomimetics of swimming fish for underwater sensing applications, developing physiological models for metastatic cancers, inventing novel medical devices, exploring 3D printing of nanostructures and macrostructures, and developing coatings to create nonstick surfaces..The department carries out its mission with a focus on the seven areas of excellence described below. Our education and research agendas are informed by these areas, and these are the areas in which we seek to impassion the best undergraduate and graduate students..Area 1: Mechanics: Modeling, Experimentation, and Computation (MMEC)..At the heart of mechanical engineering lies the ability to measure, describe, and model the physical world of materials and mechanisms. The MMEC area focuses on teaching the fundamental principles, essential skills, and scientific tools necessary for predicting thermo-mechanical phenomena and using such knowledge in rational engineering design. We provide students with the foundations in experimental, modeling, and computational skills needed to understand, exploit, and enhance the thermo-physical behavior of advanced engineering devices and systems, and to make lifelong creative contributions at the forefront of the mechanical sciences and beyond. Research in the MMEC area focuses on four key thrusts:.Computational mechanics.Fluid dynamics and transport.Mechanics of solid materials.Nonlinear dynamics.The fundamental engineering principles embodied in these topics can be applied over a vast range of force, time, and length scales, and applications of interest in the MMEC area span the spectrum from the nano/micro world to the geophysical domain. A Course 2-A track is offered in this area..Area 2: Design, Manufacturing, and Product Development..Design, manufacturing, and product development is the complete set of activities needed to bring new devices and technologies to the marketplace. These activities span the entire product life-cycle, from the identification of a market opportunity or need, through design, testing, manufacture and distribution, and end of useful life. Our work includes everything from understanding the voice of the customer to finding new ways of processing materials to improving product performance and tracking product flow through a distribution network. A central component of this area is the design and construction of novel equipment, either for consumer products or for industrial uses. This spans scales from meters to microns, and involves mechanical, electronic and electromechanical devices. Many MechE students apply design, manufacturing, and product development skills and techniques to extracurricular design work for organizations and student activities such as Design that Matters, Formula SAE, Satellite Engineering Team, and the Solar Electric Vehicle Team. Some projects lead to flagship products for new companies. A Course 2-A track in product development is offered along with a unique Master of Engineering degree in manufacturing..Area 3: Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics..The mission in this area is to promote research and education for automating, monitoring, and manipulating systems. The focus is on system-level behavior that emerges primarily from interactions and cannot be explained from individual component behavior alone. We seek to identify fundamental principles and methodologies that enable systems to exhibit intelligent, goal-oriented behavior, and develop innovative instruments to monitor, manipulate, and control systems. The core competencies in which we seek to excel are:.Methodologies for understanding system behavior through physical modeling, identification, and estimation..Technologies for sensors and sensor networks; actuators and energy transducers; and systems for monitoring, processing, and communicating information..Fundamental theories and methodologies for analyzing, synthesizing, and controlling systems; learning and adapting to unknown environments; and effectively achieving task goals..We seek to apply our core competencies to diverse areas of social, national, and global needs. These include health care, security, education, medical and security related imaging, space and ocean exploration, and autonomous systems in air, land, and underwater environments. We also offer a Course 2-A track in this area..Area 4: Energy Science and Engineering..Energy is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity and is a central focus of mechanical engineering's contribution to society. Our research focuses on efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion and utilization from fossil and renewable resources. Programs in the department cover many of the fundamental and technological aspects of energy, with applications to high performance combustion engines, batteries and fuel cells, thermoelectricity and photovoltaics, wind turbines, and efficient buildings. Work in very-low-temperature thermodynamics includes novel sub-Kelvin refrigeration. Efforts in high-temperature thermodynamics and its coupling with transport and chemistry include internal combustion engine analysis, design, and technology; control of combustion dynamics and emissions; thermoelectric energy conversion; low- and high-temperature fuel cells; and novel materials for rechargeable batteries and thermal energy storage. Work in heat and mass transport covers thermal control of electronics from manufacturing to end use; microscale and nanoscale transport phenomena; desalination and water purification; high heat flux engineering; and energy-efficient building technology. Work in renewable energy encompasses the design of offshore and floating wind turbines and tidal wave machines; and analysis and manufacturing of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic devices. Energy storage, hybrid systems, fuel synthesis, and integration of energy systems are active research areas in the department. We also offer a Course 2-A track in energy..Area 5: Ocean Science and Engineering..The oceans cover over 70 percent of the planet's surface and constitute a critical element in our quality of life, including the climate and the resources and food that we obtain from the sea. This area's objectives are to support the undergraduate and graduate programs in ocean engineering, including the naval construction program, the MIT/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Applied Oceanography and the Course 2-OE degree in mechanical and ocean engineering. It also serves as the focus point of ocean-related research and education at MIT. Major current research activities include marine robotics and navigation of underwater vehicles and smart sensors for ocean mapping and exploration; biomimetics to extract new understanding for the development of novel ocean systems studying marine animals; the study of the mechanics and fluid mechanics of systems for ultradeep ocean gas and oil extraction; ocean wave and offshore wind energy extraction; the free surface hydrodynamics of ocean-going vehicles; the development of advanced naval and commercial ships and submersibles, including the all-electric ship; the mechanics and crashworthiness of ocean ships and structures; ocean transportation systems; ocean acoustics for communication, detection, and mapping in the ocean; and adaptive sampling and multidisciplinary forecasting of the ocean behavior. The design of complex ocean systems permeates all these areas and provides the cohesive link for our research and teaching activities..Area 6: Bioengineering..Engineering analysis, design, and synthesis are needed to understand biological processes and to harness them successfully for human use. Mechanical forces and structures play an essential role in governing the function of cells, tissues, and organs. Our research emphasizes integration of molecular-to-systems–level approaches to probe the behavior of natural biological systems, and to design and build new systems, ranging from analysis of gene regulatory networks to microfluidic assays for drug screening or new technologies for quantitative, high-throughput biomedical imaging. Emphasis is also placed on creating new physiological or disease models, including multicellular engineered living systems, using nano- and micro-fabrication as well as new biomaterials. Applications include understanding, diagnosing, and treating diseases such as atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, spinal cord injury or liver failure; new tools for drug discovery and drug development; and tissue-engineered scaffolds and devices for in vivo regeneration of tissues and organs. Work also includes design and fabrication of new devices and tools for rehabilitation of stroke victims and for robotic surgery. We offer many elective subjects at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as a bioengineering track in Course 2-A..Area 7: Nano/Micro Science and Technology..The miniaturization of devices and systems of ever-increasing complexity has been a fascinating and productive engineering endeavor during the past few decades. Near and long term, this trend will be amplified as physical understanding of the nano world expands, and widespread commercial demand drives the application of manufacturing to micro- and nanosystems. Micro- and nanotechnology can have tremendous impact on a wide range of mechanical systems. Examples include microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices and products that are already deployed as automobile airbag sensors, smart phone parts, and for drug delivery; stronger and lighter nanostructured materials now used in airplanes and automobiles; and nanostructured energy conversion devices that significantly improve the efficiency of renewable energy systems. Research in this area cuts across mechanical engineering and other disciplines. Examples include sensors and actuators; micro-fluidics, heat transfer, and energy conversion at the micro- and nanoscales; optical and biological micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS); engineered nanomaterials; atomic scale precision engineering; and the nano-phoptonics in measurement, sensing, and systems design. Students interested in micro/nano technology are encouraged to explore the Course 2-A nanoengineering track..In order to prepare the mechanical engineers of the future, the department has developed undergraduate and graduate educational programs of the depth and breadth necessary to address the diverse and rapidly changing technological challenges that society faces. Our educational programs combine the rigor of academic study with the excitement and creativity inherent to innovation and research..Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (Course 2).Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Course 2-A).Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Ocean Engineering (Course 2-OE).Minor in Mechanical Engineering.Undergraduate Study.The Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) offers three programs of undergraduate study.

These degrees are not a stepping stone to the PhD..The Doctor of Philosophy (or Science), the highest academic degree offered, is awarded upon the completion of a program of advanced study and significant original research, design, or development..Admission Requirements for Graduate Study.Applications to the mechanical engineering graduate program are accepted from persons who have completed, or will have completed by the time they arrive, a bachelor's degree if they are applying for a master's degree, or a master's degree if they are applying for a PhD. Most incoming students have a degree in mechanical engineering or ocean engineering, or some related branch of engineering. The department's admission criteria are not specific, however, and capable students with backgrounds in different branches of engineering or in science may gain entry. Nevertheless, to qualify for a graduate degree, the candidate is expected to have had at least an undergraduate-level exposure to the core subject areas in mechanical engineering (applied mechanics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, materials, control systems, and design) and to be familiar with basic electrical circuits and electromagnetic field theory..Applications for September entry are due on December 15 of the previous year and decisions are reported in March. International students applying from abroad may be admitted, but they will be allowed to register only if they have full financial support for the first year..All applicants to the graduate program in mechanical engineering must submit the GRE test results. International students whose native language is not English are required to take either the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam and receive a minimum score of 7 or the TOEFL exam with a minimum acceptable score of 577 (PBT), 233 (CBT) or 100 (iBT)..Early Admission to Master's Degree Programs in Mechanical Engineering.At the end of the junior year, extraordinarily qualified students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering will be invited to apply for early admission to the graduate program. Students who are admitted will then be able to enroll in core graduate subjects during the senior year and to find a faculty advisor who is willing to start and supervise research for the master's thesis while the student is still in the senior year. With the consent of the faculty advisor, the student may also use a portion of the work conducted towards the master's thesis in the senior undergraduate year to satisfy the requirements of the bachelor's thesis..Writing Ability Requirement.The Mechanical Engineering Department requires that all incoming graduate students demonstrate satisfactory English writing ability, or successfully complete appropriate training in writing. This requirement reflects the faculty's conviction that writing is an essential skill for all engineers. All incoming graduate students, native as well as international, must take the departmental writing ability test, which is administered online in June. Depending on the results, a student will either pass or be required to take a short course during the.Independent Activities Period (IAP).in January..Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering.To qualify for the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, a student must complete at least 72 credits of coursework, not including thesis. Of these, at least 48 must be graduate subjects (refer to the.Guide to Graduate Study [PDF].on the MechE website). The remainder of the 72 units may include advanced undergraduate subjects that are not requirements in the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum..At least three of the graduate subjects must be taken in mechanical engineering sciences (refer to the.Guide to Graduate Study [PDF].on the MechE website). Students must take at least one graduate mathematics subject (12 units) offered by the MIT Mathematics Department. For the Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering, see also the requirements listed in the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution..Finally, a thesis is required. The thesis is an original work of research, development, or design, performed under the supervision of a faculty or research staff member, and is a major part of any graduate program in the Mechanical Engineering Department. A master's student usually spends as much time on thesis work as on coursework. A master's degree usually takes about one and one-half to two years to complete..Master of Science in Ocean Engineering/Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering/Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering.The requirements for each of these three degrees are that the student takes 72 credit units of graduate subjects and complete a thesis..At least three of the subjects must be chosen from a prescribed list of ocean engineering subjects (refer to the.Guide to Graduate Study [PDF].on the MechE website). Students must also take at least one graduate mathematics subject (12 units) offered by MIT's Mathematics Department. For the Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering, see also the requirements listed under the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution..The required thesis is an original work of research, development, or design, conducted under the supervision of a faculty or senior research staff member. The thesis usually takes between one and two years to complete..Master of Engineering in Advanced Manufacturing and Design.The.Master of Engineering in Advanced Manufacturing and Design.is a 12-month professional degree in mechanical engineering that is intended to prepare the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the manufacturing industries. The degree is aimed at practitioners who will use this knowledge to become leaders in existing, as well emerging, manufacturing companies. To qualify for this degree, a student must complete a highly integrated set of subjects and projects that cover the process, product, system, and business aspects of manufacturing, totaling 90 units, plus complete a group-based thesis project with a manufacturing industry. While centered in engineering and firmly grounded in the engineering sciences, this degree program considers the entire enterprise of manufacturing. Students will gain both a broad understanding of the many facets of manufacturing and a knowledge of manufacturing fundamentals from which to build new technologies and businesses. The admission process is identical to that of the Master of Science degree, with the exception that two additional essay questions are required..Learners who earn an.MITx Principles of Manufacturing MicroMasters Credential.may apply to the Advanced Manufacturing and Design program and, upon acceptance, would be credited 48 units of advanced standing credit (equivalent to approximately one-third of the full degree program and one semester on campus)..Mechanical Engineer's Degree.The Mechanical Engineer's degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond the master's level for those who wish to enter engineering practice rather than research. This degree emphasizes breadth of knowledge in mechanical engineering and its economic and social implications, and is quite distinct from the PhD, which emphasizes depth and originality of research..The engineer's degree requires a broad program of advanced coursework in mechanical engineering totaling at least 162 credit units (typically about 14 subjects), including those taken during the master's degree program. The engineer's degree program is centered around the application of engineering principles to advanced engineering problems and includes a Mechanical Engineering examination and an applications-oriented thesis, which may be an extension of a suitable master's thesis. An engineer's degree typically requires at least one year of study beyond the master's degree..Naval Engineer's Degree—Program in Naval Construction and Engineering.The Naval Construction and Engineering (NVE) program provides US Navy and US Coast Guard officers, foreign naval officers, and civilian students interested in ships and ship design a broad graduate-level education for a career as a naval engineer..The program leads to the Naval Engineer's degree, which requires a higher level of professional competence and broader range of knowledge than is required for the degree of Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering or Ocean Engineering. Subjects in the areas of economics, industrial management, and public policy and law, and at least 12 units of comprehensive design are required, in addition to an in-depth curriculum that includes naval architecture, hydrodynamics, ship structures, materials science, and power and propulsion. The program is appropriate for naval officers and civilians who plan to participate in the design and construction of naval ships, as well as those interested in commercial ship design..For students working toward a simultaneous Naval Engineer's degree and a master's degree, a single thesis is generally acceptable, provided it is appropriate to the specifications of both degrees, demonstrating an educational maturity expected of the Naval Engineer's degree..Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science.The highest academic degree is the Doctor of Science, or Doctor of Philosophy (the two differ only in name). This degree is awarded upon the completion of a program of advanced study, and the performance of significant original research, design, or development. Doctoral degrees are offered in all areas represented by the department's faculty..Students become candidates for the doctorate by passing the doctoral qualifying examinations. The doctoral program includes a major program of advanced study in the student's principal area of interest, and a minor program of study in a different field. The MechE Graduate Office should be consulted about the deadline for passing the qualifying exam..The principal component of the program is the thesis. The thesis is a major, original work that makes a significant research, development, or design contribution in its field. The thesis and the program of study are done under a faculty supervisor and a doctoral committee selected by the student and his or her supervisor, and perhaps other interested faculty members. The committee makes an annual examination of the candidate's progress and makes a final recommendation for a public defense of the work. The doctoral program typically requires three years of work beyond the master's degree, although this time is strongly topic dependent..Interdisciplinary Programs.Graduate students registered in the Department of Mechanical Engineering may elect to participate in interdisciplinary programs of study..Computational Science and Engineering.The.Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM).is an interdisciplinary program for students interested in the development, analysis, and application of computational approaches to science and engineering. The curriculum is designed with a common core serving all science and engineering disciplines and an elective component focusing on specific disciplinary topics. Students may pursue the CSE SM as a standalone degree or as leading to the CSE PhD program described below..The.Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE PhD).allows students to specialize at the doctoral level in a computation-related field of their choice through focused coursework and a thesis through one of the participating host departments in the School of Engineering or School of Science. The program is administered jointly by the Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE) and the host departments; the emphasis of thesis research activities is the development of new computational methods and/or the innovative application of computational techniques to important problems in engineering and science..For more information,.see the program descriptions.under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs..Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.The.Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).is intended for students whose primary career objective is oceanography or oceanographic engineering. Students divide their academic and research efforts between the campuses of MIT and WHOI. Joint Program students are assigned an MIT faculty member as academic advisor; thesis research may be supervised by MIT or WHOI faculty. While in residence at MIT, students follow a program similar to that of other students in their home department. The.program is described in more detail.under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs..Leaders for Global Operations.The 24-month.Leaders for Global Operations (LGO).program.combines.graduate degrees in engineering and management for those with.previous postgraduate.work experience.and strong undergraduate degrees in a technical field...During the two-year program, students complete a six-month internship.at one of LGO's partner companies, where.they conduct.research that.forms the basis of.a dual-degree thesis. Students finish the program with two MIT degrees: an MBA (or SM in management) and an SM from one of seven engineering programs, some of which have optional or required LGO tracks..After graduation, alumni.lead strategic initiatives in high-tech, operations, and manufacturing companies..Polymers and Soft Matter.The.Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM).offers students from participating departments an interdisciplinary core curriculum in polymer science and engineering, exposure to the broader polymer community through seminars, contact with visitors from industry and academia, and interdepartmental collaboration while working towards a PhD or ScD degree..Research opportunities include functional polymers, controlled drug delivery, nanostructured polymers, polymers at interfaces, biomaterials, molecular modeling, polymer synthesis, biomimetic materials, polymer mechanics and rheology, self-assembly, and polymers in energy. The.program is described in more detail.under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs..Technology and Policy.The Master of Science in Technology and Policy is an engineering research degree with a strong focus on the role of technology in policy analysis and formulation. The.Technology and Policy Program (TPP).curriculum provides a solid grounding in technology and policy by combining advanced subjects in the student's chosen technical field with courses in economics, politics, quantitative methods, and social science. Many students combine TPP's curriculum with complementary subjects to obtain dual degrees in TPP and either a specialized branch of engineering or an applied social science such as political science or urban studies and planning. See the.program description.under the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society..Financial Support.The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers three types of financial assistance to graduate students: research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and fellowships..The majority of students in the department are supported by research assistantships (RAs), which are appointments to work on particular research projects with particular faculty members. Faculty members procure research grants for various projects and hire graduate students to carry out the research. The research is almost invariably structured so that it becomes the student's thesis. An RA appointment provides a full-tuition scholarship (i.e., covers all tuition) plus a salary that is adequate for a single person. The financial details are outlined in a separate handout available from the MechE Graduate Office. An RA may register for a maximum of 24 units (about two subjects) of classroom subjects per regular term and 12 units in the summer term, and must do at least the equivalent of 24 units of thesis (i.e., research on the project) per term. (Please note that Master of Engineering in Manufacturing students are not eligible for RA or TA positions since their subject credits exceed these limits.).Teaching assistants (TAs) are appointed to work on specific subjects of instruction. As the name implies, they usually assist a faculty member in teaching, often grading homework problems and tutoring students. In the Mechanical Engineering Department, TAs are very seldom used for regular full-time classroom teaching. Full-time TAs are limited to 24 units of credit per regular term, including both classroom subjects and thesis. The TA appointment does not usually extend through the summer..A fellowship provides the student with a direct grant, and leaves the student open to select his or her own research project and supervisor. A limited number of awards and scholarships are available to graduate students directly through the department. A number of students are also supported by fellowships from outside agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, and Department of Defense. Scholarships are awarded each year by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. These awards are normally granted to applicants whose interest is focused on naval architecture and marine engineering or on ocean engineering. Applications are made directly to the granting agency, and inquiries for the fall term should be made in the preceding fall term..Prospective students are invited to communicate with the Department regarding any of these educational and financial opportunities..Experience has shown that the optimum graduate program consists of about equal measures of coursework and research, consistent with an RA appointment. The main advantage of a fellowship is a greater freedom in choosing a research project and supervisor. A teaching assistantship gives the student teaching experience and can also be extremely valuable for reviewing basic subject material—for example, in preparation for the doctoral qualifying exams. It does not, however, leave much time for thesis research and may extend the time that the student needs to complete his or her degree..Inquiries.For additional information on mechanical engineering graduate admissions, contact Una Sheehan.

their first two years in the Joint Program. Typically these will include 4 core courses, 2 math courses and 6 or more electives. This number is a recommendation and not a requirement – there are no formal physical oceanography course requirements in the Joint Program. In addition, students are expected to attend research seminars and to complete widespread independent reading of the literature. They are encouraged to explore the diverse course offerings in other departments at MIT as well as to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-register at Harvard or Brown..Core courses and mathematics.The core curriculum is intended to provide the minimum, essential foundation for students pursuing research in physical oceanography or an interdisciplinary field including physical oceanography. Students typically take 4 area-specific core courses..For students interested in General Physical Oceanography, these are typically:.Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean (12.800).Introduction to Observational Physical Oceanography (12.808).Steady Circulation of the Ocean and Atmosphere (12.801).Wave Motions in the Ocean and Atmosphere (12.802).For students with interdisciplinary interests, one or two of these courses (usually 12.801 or 12.802) are substitute with a more area-specific core course. Several area-specific, alternative core-courses are listed below:.Physical Oceanography and Climate.12.812  General Circulation of the Atmosphere (F).12.801  General Circulation of the ocean (S).Physical-biological-chemical Interactions.12.742  Marine Chemistry (F).7.47      Biological Oceanography (S).Coastal/Nearshore Physical Oceanography and Engineering.1.69      Coastal Engineering (F).And one of.12.862   Coastal Physical Oceanography (F).12.802   Wave Motions in the Ocean and Atmosphere (S).Students typically take these courses during their first year unless they have had prior experience with the subject matter before entering..In addition, most research topics in physical oceanography require an understanding of the methods of applied mathematics. We recommend that students take two Applied Math courses..Electives.The core curricula have been kept to a minimum in order to allow each student to define a program of elective courses that are tailored to their research interest. Some of the most common and relevant electives are indicated within the different curricula by an asterisk (*). In addition, to help prepare for research on these diverse topics, Joint Program students may choose elective courses from the offerings of any MIT or WHOI department and cross-registration is available with Harvard. The list of possible elective is thus very extensive. Students are encouraged to consult the sample curricula as well as the appropriate course catalogues. Students are expected to define their own, personal paths through an elective course program, with advice from their major advisor and other academic staff members..Physical oceanography students take around 14 to 16 courses during their first two years in residence.

This paper now uses such an enterprise control model to demonstrate the multiple timescale effects as a consequence of ESS integration into a single control action. It also proposes a novel scheduling technique which beneficially exploits this coupling in two timescales. As a result, the ESS scheduling technique shows peak-loading shaving and operating costs reductions in the SCUC and load following reserve requirements in the SCED..Close.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7028898.doi:10.1109/ISGTEurope.2014.7028898.Close.44..A Muzhikyan; A M Farid; K Youcef-Toumi.An Enterprise Control Assessment Method for Variable Energy Resource-Induced Power System Imbalances—Part II: Parametric Sensitivity Analysis.Journal Article.In:.IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,.vol. 62,.no. 4,.pp. 2459-2467,.2015.,.ISSN: 1557-9948...Abstract.|.Links.|.BibTeX.|.Tags:.Algorithms.,.Control Theory.,.intelligent systems.,.Modeling.,.Simulation.,.sizing and control of smart grids.@article{MRL_AFM_Enterprise_Control_Assessment,.title = {An Enterprise Control Assessment Method for Variable Energy Resource-Induced Power System Imbalances—Part II: Parametric Sensitivity Analysis},.author = {A Muzhikyan and A M Farid and K Youcef-Toumi},.url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7018074?denied=},.doi = {10.1109/TIE.2015.2395380},.issn = {1557-9948},.year  = {2015},.date = {2015-01-22},.journal = {IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics},.volume = {62},.number = {4},.pages = {2459-2467},.publisher = {IEEE},.abstract = {In recent years, renewable energy has developed to address energy security and climate change drivers.

Numerous activities and groups are available that complement academic pursuits and provide opportunities for students to grow and develop new interests or lifelong pursuits. Student organizations help students develop leadership skills, build important life skills, and make connections with others through social interaction. This section describes just a few of the activities that add to campus life..There are over 450 co-curricular student organizations at MIT, including the Outing Club, the Solar Electric Vehicle Team, the Debate Team, the FM local broadcasting station (WMBR), the MIT Society for Women Engineers, the Student Art Association, Model UN,.and interest groups focusing on dance, chess, ham radio, and strategic games, to name a few..Many students are actively engaged in service work. Groups such as Amphibious Achievement and the Educational Studies Program sponsor active social and public service programs. For example, the Educational Studies Program provides opportunities for MIT students to work with area high school students and tutor middle school children..MIT also has a number of cultural and identity groups, including the Black Students' Union, the Latino Cultural Center, the Asian American Association, the Native American Student Association, and the South Asian American Students Association. Over 30 international student organizations sponsor a rich array of programs, including discussion groups and social events. The International Students' Association, for example, sponsors a newsletter, assemblies, and other events. For members and allies of MIT's LGBTQ+ community, G@MIT organizes weekly awareness programs and discussion groups, and sponsors social events throughout the year. The Graduate Women at MIT (GWAMIT) works to promote the personal and professional development of women in graduate school at MIT. MIT also has over 30 religious groups that represent a diversity of faith and spiritual interests..For more information, contact the.Student Organizations, Leadership, and Engagement., Room W20-500, 617-253-6777..Admissions.Financial Aid.Registrar.IAP.Summer.Professional Education.MITx.K-12.Campus Map.Directories.About the Bulletin.Nondiscrimination Policy.Changes.Help.Accessibility.77 Massachusetts Avenue.Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.Back to top.Print Options.Send Page to Printer.Print this page..Download PDF of this Page.The PDF includes all information on this page and its related tabs.

They also walked faster, avoided obstacles more easily, and climbed stairs more naturally than people with a traditional amputation, while reporting less pain and muscular atrophy. 

The study was conducted by researchers at MIT and.Brigham and Women's Hospital., and published in Nature Medicine (.Nature Portfolio.).

However, my prep did allow me to skip the first two or three years of EE undergrad classes. Here’s what I did: I studied up on basic concepts in EE like circuit analysis and signal processing by watching online lectures (e.g., MIT Open Courseware is a nice free site). A couple months before starting the Master’s I even bought a textbook used by an intermediate undergraduate class at my school about electromagnetics (my topic of interest in EE) and used it for taking notes and doing practice problems..In other words, my suggestion is to figure out the basics of what MechE students at your level should know and start picking up on it. Definitely make sure your physics and math knowledge are up to par before anything (for example, engineering students use a lot of differential equations). You can learn more about what the basics are by checking the courses that MechE undergrads are required to take at your new school). Then supplement all of the gaps in your knowledge with course lectures, reading, and practice problems (from textbooks, online materials, or otherwise), and feel free to take down notes for yourself to grasp the important stuff!.In the end, you don't have to have a Master’s level knowledge in MechE by the time you get there, but it's important that you understand what you do and don't know and choose your classes accordingly.

There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers. The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields. Basically the system as a whole..Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest. I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot. The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field. The Labs are world class. Research is a bit lagging. Practical exposure is excellent. But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc. which is gold if you love robotics..If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field. Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study. However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India..I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics. There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics..Upvote.·.99.18.9.2.9.1.Anonymous.Upvoted by.Vivek Bhat.,.studied at Manipal Institute Of Technology (2022).and.Aseem Shrivastava.,.B.Tech Mechatronics, Manipal Institute Of Technology (2015).·.10y.Related.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.MIT, Manipal is one of the few colleges that provide an education in Mechatronics Engineering.

The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago..As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:.1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects. They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal.

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:.1. Not paying off credit card debt..Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt..But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (.National Debt Relief., for example) are willing to help you with your debt..Here’s how it typically works:.You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc. combined)..A company like.National Debt Relief.(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc. to try and reduce your debt..A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe. Here’s an example from.NDR.’s site:.*E.g. Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR..If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so..Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate., if you’re interested..See if you qualify for debt relief..2. Not getting a financial advisor..99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake..Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time..People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year.(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time..But more important:.a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of.If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like.WiserAdvisor.) and find somebody near you that has good reviews..Or if you want something easier,.here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs..3. Not using an ad blocker..If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am.begging.you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life..A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet..No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible..Most people I know use Total Adblock (.link here.) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options..Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice..Here’s a link to Total Adblock., if you’re interested..4. Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year..The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance..Check out a site like.Coverage.com.to compare the best car insurance options available..Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today..See how much you could save..5. Getting price gouged on the internet..You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere..Big stores like Amazon know that.no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites., so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices..I typically.hate.browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have.Capital One Shopping.installed yet, do yourself a favor and.grab it...Here’s what I mean:.I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back. Amazon’s price was $95..(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example).That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)..It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once..Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping., if you want..6. Not getting paid for your opinions..As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)..I usually use Branded Surveys (.link here.). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV..Here's the form I used to sign up.- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops..7. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)..It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)..Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (.Ark7.is one of our favorites)..They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account..It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)..If you’re interested,.take a look at Ark7’s properties here..8. Not getting paid for your screentime..There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)..I typically use.TesterUp., but there are others too. It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you.

Then most of them are always working on some project and you can work under them, or you might have your own project idea and you can ask some tecaher to help with that..And, since it's an emerging field in India, they are trying their best to give students the required exposure. This brings us to the labs which have been setup with equipments from the companies like Bosch Rexroth, ABB and Siemens. We have the following labs — PLC, Sensorics, Mechatronics, Hydraulics & Pneumatics, Robotics and Drives & Control. The Robotics Lab has ABB's 6-axis IRB robot, Drives & Control Lab has PLCs and Electric Drives provided by Bosch & the Mechatronics Lab consists of a complete miniature Modular Production System with 5 stations. And, if it makes it more likeable, they are all air-conditioned :).In spite of all these positive aspects, it all gets narrowed down to Mechatronics being not so popular in India and India being not much into automation. And that, my friend, affects the placements. The companies like Tata are specifically told to recruit from the core branches like Mechanical. The highest package goes around 7–8 Lacs for Mechatronics in Manipal. I know, you had not asked this part but I just thought that you should know..If you're interested enough, this the best branch!.All the best..Upvote.·.99.21.9.2.Promoted by Betterbuck.Anthony Madden.Writer for Betterbuck.·.Updated Apr 26.What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?.Where do I start?.I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits. Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:.1. Not paying off credit card debt..Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt..But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (.National Debt Relief., for example) are willing to help you with your debt..Here’s how it typically works:.You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc. combined)..A company like.National Debt Rel.Continue Reading.Where do I start?.I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits. Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:.1. Not paying off credit card debt..Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt..But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (.National Debt Relief., for example) are willing to help you with your debt..Here’s how it typically works:.You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc. combined)..A company like.National Debt Relief.(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc. to try and reduce your debt..A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe. Here’s an example from.NDR.’s site:.*E.g. Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR..If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so..Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate., if you’re interested..See if you qualify for debt relief..2. Not getting a financial advisor..99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake..Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time..People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year.(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time..But more important:.a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of.If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like.WiserAdvisor.) and find somebody near you that has good reviews..Or if you want something easier,.here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs..3. Not using an ad blocker..If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am.begging.you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life..A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet..No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible..Most people I know use Total Adblock (.link here.) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options..Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice..Here’s a link to Total Adblock., if you’re interested..4. Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year..The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance..Check out a site like.Coverage.com.to compare the best car insurance options available..Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today..See how much you could save..5. Getting price gouged on the internet..You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere..Big stores like Amazon know that.no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites., so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices..I typically.hate.browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have.Capital One Shopping.installed yet, do yourself a favor and.grab it...Here’s what I mean:.I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back. Amazon’s price was $95..(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example).That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)..It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once..Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping., if you want..6. Not getting paid for your opinions..As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)..I usually use Branded Surveys (.link here.). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV..Here's the form I used to sign up.- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops..7. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)..It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)..Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (.Ark7.is one of our favorites)..They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account..It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)..If you’re interested,.take a look at Ark7’s properties here..8. Not getting paid for your screentime..There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)..I typically use.TesterUp., but there are others too. It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you. I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly..Here’s a link to the app..Hope that helps someone!.Upvote.·.5.9K.5.9K.999.268.999.141.Related questions.Which is the best university in the U.S. for mechatronics, and why doesn't MIT and Stanford have mechatronics?.Does MIT offer mechatronics as a course?.Does a mechatronic degree exist in MIT?.How do I prepare myself so that I can do my master’s in mechatronics at MIT?.To study mechatronics, do I have to choose mechanical engineering at MIT?.Is mechatronics course well structured in MIT, Manipal?.Is it possible to get mechatronics in MIT at a rank of 25k?.How is MIT-ADT for mechatronics?.Which university is better for mechatronics engineering, MIT or SRM?.How is mechatronics engineering at MIT?

It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors..But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different..As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others..MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted..If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work..And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth..I hope this helps..Upvote.·.2.7K.2.7K.99.82.99.58.Related questions.More answers below.How do I prepare for MS in mechatronics?.What are the subjects for MS in mechatronics?.How is mechatronics at MIT?.How can I take admission into MIT for graduation in mechatronics?.Is it possible to get mechatronics in MIT at a rank of 25k?.Related questions.How do I prepare for MS in mechatronics?.What are the subjects for MS in mechatronics?.How is mechatronics at MIT?.How can I take admission into MIT for graduation in mechatronics?.Is it possible to get mechatronics in MIT at a rank of 25k?.Can I get a seat in mechatronics with 105/200 in MIT?.How can I get into MIT for masters?.How do I prepare myself so that I can do my master’s in mechatronics at MIT?.What are the minimum marks required for mechatronics in MIT?.How can I get into MIT for an MS?.What are some recommended courses for studying mechatronics at MIT?.After completing my B.tech in Mechanical Engineering, how can I prepare for MS in mechatronics in MIT?.What marks are required for getting a merit seat in mechatronics at MIT?.Does MIT offer mechatronics as a course?.Can I get mechatronics with 13187 rank in MIT?.Related questions.How do I prepare for MS in mechatronics?.What are the subjects for MS in mechatronics?.How is mechatronics at MIT?.How can I take admission into MIT for graduation in mechatronics?.Is it possible to get mechatronics in MIT at a rank of 25k?.Can I get a seat in mechatronics with 105/200 in MIT?.Advertisement.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

As a PhD student she worked in Media Lab Professor Hugh Herr’s Biomechatronics Group on a system that helps patients with amputation feel what their prostheses are feeling and send feedback from the device to the body. She has also studied the south Indian classical dance form Bharathanatyam for 22 years and co-directs the.Anubhava Dance Company...“The kind of relief and sense of fulfillment I get from the arts is very different from what I get from research and science,” she says. “I find that research often nourishes my intellectual curiosity, and the arts are helping to build that emotional and spiritual growth.

JP students, who remain in good academic standing, are provided financial support, consisting of.tuition.and a stipend (at least $45,480) during five years of full-time study. This support may come from a Graduate Research Assistantship that is an integral part of a research project, or it may come from a variety of.fellowships.to which applicants may apply before coming to the JP. Some students are supported by external competitive fellowships, which help the program stretch its limited financial resources and admit more students than we might be able to do without these additional resources.  If a student does not have an external fellowship then the program will provide financial assistance usually in the form of a graduate research assistantship or internal fellowship, or a combination of the two..As such, we do encourage applicants to pursue whatever options are available in their particular case for outside financial support (e.g., fellowships from organizations that sponsor graduate studies at a US-based university) since, as noted above, when a student brings in outside support, we are able to stretch our limited financial resources and admit more students than we might be able to do without these additional resources..For information on fellowships for international students., please visit the MIT Office of Graduate Education.website...We urge applicants to apply for these funds, if they are available, at the same time that the application to graduate school is submitted, so that we are made aware of the possibility of these funds in each applicant's case..Applying for outside funding is not a requirement for admission, i.e., if there are no sources of funds in your particular case, you may leave this area blank..Length of support.MIT-WHOI Joint Program students are supported for the first five years of their graduate studies toward a doctoral degree and for fewer years (typically two or three) for a Masters or Engineers degree..As a doctoral student, you can request support into a sixth year with accompanying recommendations from your advisor and from the appropriate Joint Program Committee certifying acceptable academic progress and the special circumstances requiring the sixth year of support. The sixth year of support must be approved by the Dean at WHOI for students with financial support through WHOI and by the Joint Program Director at MIT for students with financial support through MIT, after consultation with the appropriate Department Chair at WHOI or Department Head at MIT..Administration and setup.All student support, regardless of source (except personal resources of the student) is administered through the WHOI Academic Programs Office, the Joint Program Office at MIT, or the appropriate academic department at MIT. The source of the support has no effect on academic standards and responsibilities, and in most circumstances has little effect on the schedule of progress toward the degree. If your support-related responsibilities are extensive, they will be considered when evaluating your progress. You should understand the nature of the support that is available and come to a clear understanding of the obligations that financial support entails..Consultations between the Academic Programs Office at WHOI, the Joint Program office at MIT, advisors at both institutions, appropriate departments at both institutions, and the students are used to arrive at the support mechanism applicable to each student for varying periods of time (e.g., semester by semester or year by year)..Overarching guidance.All doctoral degree students, irrespective of the source of their stipend and tuition support, are expected to pursue a program of study and research in their first two years that prepares them for their Ph.D. examinations for candidacy (general examinations). Thereafter, they pursue full-time research with attendance at appropriate seminars and participation in occasional courses as recommended by their advisor and approved by the appropriate joint committee..Masters and Engineers degree students pursue a course of study and research during their two to three years leading to completion of the degree requirements. Acceptable progress in fulfilling the duties associated with the financial support received is monitored by the academic and research advisor(s) and the appropriate joint committee..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

The teaching quality is below average, with only a handful of good teachers. Most of your time will be spent just copying down from ppt, and not actually learning anything. Most of the emphasis is made on whether the student has taken notes or not, if he she has a calculator or not, the micro managing stuff. You are treated like a school kid instead of an adult. More attention should be paid to whether the student has actually learned the subject, it should not matter if someone uses calculator on his phone. Labs too are of average quality. Not something you would expect from a private engineering college with such a high fees. Regarding placements, if you want to stay in the core civil industry, then only a few civil engineering companies come to campus. And the pay will be very less too as compared to what your peers will get from other branches. If you plan to move to IT companies, then you can expect a decent pay..Don’t know if this is the case at VIT also, you will have to do your own research..Regarding student clubs, you can join one if it is of your interest, like dramatics, poetry etc etc. But the civil engineering clubs are just a waste of time(My opinion, you may find them good). Many clubs will approach you saying you will get a certificate which will be useful in CV etc etc. Again, a waste of time, instead use it for something productive like a mini project or something with your friends..civil engineering syllabus in general is very out dated..If you do not care about academics and want to live the best college life, then manipal is the place. Plenty of answers are available on quora regarding college life in Manipal vs VIT. Have a look.However, if you do plan to continue in civil engineering, from any college and stay in this field, here are a few tips I wish someone would have told me when I was in my first year..“LEARN CODING” “LEARN CODING” “LEARN CODING”.I cannot stress enough how important it is to learn coding. Start right now. Pick any language like python or c++ and just start learning. search code with harry on youtube or you can join a paid coding class if you are interested. During placements if you decide to sit for coding companies, you will compete with your friends from cs and IT, most of them would have done coding in 11th and 12th and for 4 years of their college. you will be competing with someone who has been doing coding for 6 years. So learn well..2. “LEARN EXCEL”.again, I cannot stress enough how important and useful excel is. DO NOT UNDERSTIMATE EXCEL. In your first year, there is hardly anything useful you learn as most subjects are just general. That is the time you can invest in stuff like excel. If you plan to go to manipal, you will get coursera free from the college. Even if you dont, you can still learn for free, just that you wont get a certificate. Search excel for business, it has 4 specialization courses. DO IT..After that search ‘excel for vba’. Its a course from university of Colorado boulder. 3 specializations, DO IT..So 1 coding language, 4 excel courses, 3 vba courses. This should take you your complete first year and the summer holidays..So now you are in your 2nd year..3. “LEARN AUTOCAD”.autocad is a software from autodesk. Students can get it for free for 1 year. You might say that you know autocad as it was taught in first year etc etc blah blah. ITS NOT EVEN 5% OF WHAT IS USED IN THE REAL WORLD. Its a waste of time in college. Search deepak verma autocad on youtube, learn from there. do not waste time on autocad 3d, just learn 2d. Practice everyday for a few hours and it should hardly take you a month..4. “LEARN REVIT”.again a software from autodesk, free for 1 year for students. again, search deepak verma revit on youtube and watch all videos. This can take about 2 months to get comfortable..after 3rd sem when you have learnt basic concrete design, go to fieldready.com. Buy the revit course for 5000. yes its paid, but it is totally worth it. Will take about 1 month to complete. and then you can watch youtube videos to learn how to render and create architectural views in revit. and download enscape for revit too..NOTE: You will require a good laptop to run revit, with enough amount of ram and a good gpu.There is a lab called estimation lab, that is taught in 7th sem. It is interesting and probably the only thing I could relate to in real world. Get notes from seniors or from your teachers and learn it by the end of 4th semester. Hardly takes you 15 days.Practice everything again and again, everyday, By the end of second year, you will have a huge edge over your peers in civil. After 4th sem you become eligible for internships. With the above skills you can get a very good internship where you can actually learn something useful. You can try in architectural firms, or a BIM modeler or an estimator etc..Now, you might be interested in learning STAAD pro or ETABS, as many of your friends will start learning. I would not recommend it. The amount of structural engineering you learn up to 4th semester is very basic. My recommendation would be to start learning it in 6th sem. If you plan to go in construction management field, learn microsoft project. You can get a course on udemy for 500rs..Hope you find this useful.

The Joint Program is organized within five disciplines (described below), each administered by a Joint Committee consisting of MIT and WHOI faculty members..The Joint Program offers a master’s degree program for U.S. Naval Officers, and more than 85 officers have received this degree dating back to the first award in 1970. With the exception of the U.S. Naval Officers program, students are not admitted to the Joint Program for a Master’s degree. However, a Master’s degree can be awarded in all programs on the way to a doctoral degree or as a terminal degree..The Joint Program is an ocean science program in the broadest sense. Student research projects extend beyond ocean science into earth science, hydrology, glaciology, marine conservation, and environmental chemistry, to name a few. Coursework in marine policy is not mandated by any of the Joint Committees, although there are opportunities to take policy courses at MIT and Harvard. In addition, WHOI has a Marine Policy Center, and its faculty lead informal seminars on marine policy as well as serve on thesis committees..Joint Program students have access to courses, programs and resources at one of the top oceanographic research institutions in the world (WHOI), one of the top research universities in the world (MIT), and they have the opportunity to take courses at Harvard. In addition to seminars and lectures by visiting scientists from all over the world, students can expand their intellectual horizons by taking courses or participating in programs well outside their main area of focus..The Joint Program is committed to providing five years of tuition and stipend support to every student who is admitted, assuming satisfactory progress in the program. The Joint Program also has funds to help students attend scientific meetings, conferences, and special courses and to support student research. The Joint Program provides transportation options between the two campuses as well as housing at MIT and at WHOI for qualified students..Organization: JP Structure and Interdisciplinary Research.JP Disciplines and Departmental Structure:.Each Joint Program student is associated with one primary discipline and is a member of one MIT Department and one WHOI Department. This structure allows each student to have a "home base" but also provides flexibility to support interdisciplinary research (described below).JP Discipline.MIT Department.WHOI Department.Applied Ocean Science and Engineering (AOSE).Aeronautics and Astronautics (Aero-Astro), Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), OR Mechanical Engineering (MechE).Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering (AOP&E).Biological Oceanography (BO).Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); Biology; OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Biology.Chemical Oceanography (CO).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry (MC&G).Marine Geology and Geophysics (MG&G).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS); OR Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).Geology and Geophysics (G&G).Physical Oceanography (PO).Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).Physical Oceanography (PO).Interdisciplinary Research:.Many students conduct interdisciplinary research; common interdisciplinary themes include climate science and coastal processes. The Joint Program leadership works to support and accommodate students with interdisciplinary interests (see.interdisciplinary statement and thesis examples.). Thesis committees frequently include faculty members from multiple disciplines, such as biologists and engineers, chemists and geologists, or physical oceanographers and biologists ..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

life in the oceans—the distribution, abundance, and production of marine species along with the processes that govern species' spread and development..In the Joint Program, biological oceanography is also a study in extremes....In size, from the tiny microbes in the water column to the 30-meter blue whale.In depth, from blooms of cyanobacteria covering thousands of square kilometers of the ocean's surface, to hydrothermal vent colonies emerging eerily from the mile-deep dark.In locale, from the lab next door to the deck of a research vessel bucking ice flows in the Arctic.Extreme habitats.Studying organisms that occupy extreme habitats, such as the deep sea or polar regions, presents major challenges for accessibility and sampling. Meeting these challenges has had exciting results. The discovery of biological communities near hydrothermal vents, for example, led to new perceptions about the evolution of life, the discovery of unusual symbioses, and new insights on adaptation in the deep sea..Lab to ocean.Another set of challenges lies in comparing data from lab experiments and observations on individual organisms with the patterns we see during field studies and ocean cruises. Laboratory work, such as isolating cyanobacteria in pure culture or sequencing genomes, underlies our interpretation of how populations respond in nature..Different faces of biological oceanography.Biological oceanographers study:.Chemical and physical factors influencing distribution patterns.Physiological,.behavioral, and biochemical adaptations to environmental variables,.including natural variations in food, temperature, pressure, light, and.the chemical environment.Food chain dynamics.Nutrient cycling and initial steps of chemical energy fixation.Responses to the results of man's activities in the oceans.In this broad range of work, you can see the many faces of biological oceanography. Answering research questions may require studies in microbiology, planktonology, ichthyology, benthic biology, taxonomy, ecology, biogeochemistry, cell biology, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, animal behavior, bioacoustics, and applied mathematics..Interdisciplinary work.In the Joint Program, investigators in many disciplines work together with a unified goal of understanding the interactions between organisms and between organisms and the environment. The chemical and physical processes that influence species distribution and abundance are an integral part of biological oceanography. Likewise, biological processes in the oceans influence the chemistry of the seas, sediments, and even the atmosphere on local and global scales..Research tools and techniques.To explore and define the roles of organisms in the marine environment, biological oceanographers employ a wide range of research tools and techniques. There are many technological challenges in the development of new instrumental and analytical techniques. The technological future of biological oceanography depends on advances in methods of data acquisition, sampling and culture techniques, and parallel progress in most fields of biology..Researchers also adapt existing methodologies, such as flow cytometry, immunology, and high-resolution video analysis, to work in both the lab and the field..Unique opportunity to combine approaches.The Joint Program offers a unique opportunity for training and research in areas that combine different approaches to the study of biological oceanography. For example, you can:.Learn.the principles and methodologies of molecular biology and apply this.knowledge in the study of complex marine systems in areas such as.molecular phylogeny and population genetics.Apply bioacoustics to the study of spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution and abundance of marine organisms.Apply mathematics to the development of population models.MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

For students entering with appropriate undergraduate preparation (a Bachelor of Science or equivalent degree in a relevant science), the academic program is typically made up of two years of graduate-level course work. Courses may be selected from a course list offered specifically by the Joint Program as well as the full range of courses at MIT. Midway through the first year or at the end of the second year, doctoral students then take a qualifying examination that tests their preparation to go forward with thesis research. When passed, the student will then present a proposal of thesis research, normally about six months after their qualifying exam. From there, the student will then focus on their thesis research, which requires another two to three years. Students who enter the program with a Master of Science degree may be able to complete the doctoral program in a shorter amount of time..During the classroom-intensive phase of their studies, students are expected to be in residence near MIT. When students are no longer taking classes full time, they are expected to reside where their advisor/lab is located and to obtain housing in the local community. Students at either campus have access to a wide range of facilities and other resources including transportation to and from WHOI and MIT..Students who have academic interests that span two or more science disciplines may readily combine courses and other academic preparation drawn from these disciplines. Joint Program policy is aimed to facilitate such interdisciplinary studies and includes examples of recent Joint Program students' curriculum..All entering students are assigned a primary academic advisor chosen from the faculty of either MIT or WHOI, and are also assigned to a home discipline from the list below. These important choices are made based upon either a student's request at the time of the application or admission or based upon a match of the student's preparation and stated interests. It is not unusual for a student to change advisors or home disciplines as s/he develops specific research interests..During the first semester, or as early as practical, each Joint Program student should form an Academic Advisory Committee to plan a tentative, individualized course of study. The Academic Advisory Committee will consist of the student's primary academic advisor and at least one other faculty member, ideally from the other institution. The student's Academic Advisory Committee will be responsible for monitoring his/her progress up to and through the general exam, after which the oversight will shift to the student's Ph.D. thesis committee..» View Program Description and Philosophy.Academic Guidance.Applied Ocean Science and Engineering.Keywords:.fluid mechanics, acoustics, vehicles, instruments.Biological Oceanography.Keywords:.phytoplankton, zooplankton, microbial ecology, marine mammals, environmental toxicology, larval ecology, benthic ecology, mathematical ecology, population genetics, microbiology, fish ecology, biogeochemistry.Chemical Oceanography.Keywords:.air-sea exchange, atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemistry, carbon cycle science, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, global change, ocean tracers, radiochemistry.Marine Geology and Geophysics.Keywords:.seafloor volcanic, tectonic and hydrothermal processes, mantle dynamics, ocean crustal structure, continental rifting, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, coastal processes.Physical Oceanography.Keywords:.physics, fluid dynamics, applied mathematics, observations, theory, modeling, ocean circulation, climate.MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

students in physical oceanography. However, students do need a solid foundation in fluid mechanics, mathematics, and descriptive oceanography. Students interested in interdisciplinary research which overlaps with physical oceanography can tailor their individual curriculum to obtain an appropriate background for the field of interest. See.Curriculum.for more details..1st and 2nd years.Most students spend the first one to one-half years on coursework, although they are encouraged to start research as soon as possible. Why?.To build expertise in identifying a field of interest.To develop a firm understanding of the state of knowledge within the field.To single out possible research/thesis topics.General exams.Students typically complete a written research project, and written and oral exams at the end of the second year. After passing these, students prepare and defend a thesis proposal within four months..The General Exam Committee (GEC) for physical oceanography evaluates:.The student's grasp of material covered in the core curriculum and/or other courses specific to the student's individual course of study, as well as the ability to synthesize material from different sources.The student's ability to approach research problems in a manner appropriate for an independent scientist.3rd through 5th years.Students spend the remaining years in the program on dissertation research and writing. However, they may complete additional courses to broaden their perspective or obtain knowledge necessary for their thesis research..Students are encouraged to maintain close contact with their thesis committees through regular discussions with committee members and periodic formal committee meetings approximately every six months. A student's thesis committee includes the principal research advisor and three to five faculty members with interest and expertise in the research area. The committee must have one member each from MIT and WHOI and may have members from outside the Joint Program..Oral defense.The Ph.D. is completed by a successful public defense of the thesis research, followed by a closed questioning period with the thesis committee and submission of the written thesis. Students are strongly encouraged to complete their theses before the end of the fifth year. Extension into the sixth year is possible after formal petition to the Joint Committee for Physical Oceanography..Related Files.Joint Program Physical Oceanography Handbook (pdf).For more information regarding the field of Physical Oceanography and its requirements, please refer to the discipline's handbook..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Then most of them are always working on some project and you can work under them, or you might have your own project idea and you can ask some tecaher to help with that..And, since it's an emerging field in India, they are trying their best to give students the required exposure. This brings us to the labs which have been setup with equipments from the companies like Bosch Rexroth, ABB and Siemens. We have the following labs — PLC, Sensorics, Mechatronics, Hydraulics & Pneumatics, Robotics and Drives & Control. The Robotics Lab has ABB's 6-axis IRB robot, Drives & Control Lab has PLCs and Electric Drives provided by Bosch & the Mechatronics Lab consists of a complete miniature Modular Production System with 5 stations. And, if it makes it more likeable, they are all air-conditioned :).In spite of all these positive aspects, it all gets narrowed down to Mechatronics being not so popular in India and India being not much into automation. And that, my friend, affects the placements. The companies like Tata are specifically told to recruit from the core branches like Mechanical. The highest package goes around 7–8 Lacs for Mechatronics in Manipal.

They should also discuss any upcoming fieldwork (timing and duration), and whether it is optional or required..Advisors should make expectations clear to the student, including how frequently the advisor and student should meet.  The advisor should make him/herself available to provide advice to the student, and clarify with the student how best to set up meetings – e.g., regular weekly meetings, or meetings as needed with some amount of lead time so that the advisor can set aside time, etc.  Likewise the student should feel comfortable communicating with the advisor regarding the frequency of meetings..Students are expected to devote full-time effort academic activities, including time devoted to classes, research activities, and any activities specific to Research or Teaching Assistant duties.  If supported as a Graduate Research Assistant, 20 hours per week on average should be devoted to work on the grant/contract.  If supported as a Teaching Assistant, the student is expected to devote 20 hours per week to Teaching Assistantship activities (10 hours/wk for half-time TA)..Students are entitled to two weeks of vacation per year and should clear vacation schedules in advance with advisor(s). It is useful for students and advisors to discuss expectations given that many oceanography students spend considerable time in the field.  Information about terms of appointments can be found.here...Advisors and students should discuss authorship protocol (e.g., when is someone an author vs. acknowledged; when is someone first author; etc.), and scientific conduct.  Training in scientific conduct is now required by some funding agencies.  Ethics training is available, and advisors should encourage students to take advantage of such training..Advisors should make best efforts to fund students fully, and encourage (and assist as needed) students to submit fellowship applications.  If the student has his/her own funding through a fellowship, and wishes to pursue research not covered by existing grants, the student needs to have the advisor’s permission and support.  The student and the advisor then need to openly discuss possibilities and how other costs (e.g., lab supplies and analyses) will be covered.  The burden of funding the student and his/her research costs falls on the advisor, thus the need for the advisor being in agreement that the student should pursue this research..Regular feedback should be provided to the student about progress, and if the student is not fulfilling the advisor’s expectations, the advisor should bring that to the student’s attention in a timely manner so that the student can address the concern (rather than waiting until the semester’s end or as part of the annual review)..Advisors and students should discuss progress at annual review time and go over any issues or concerns.  On all submitted memos/paperwork, copy Tricia Nesti and Sarah Moriarty (who will save the correspondence in the student’s file)..As the student’s research progresses, the advisor(s) should encourage participation in scientific meetings and assist with writing and submitting abstracts, choice of sessions and travel costs, and encourage and assist with networking at meetings.  Both MIT and WHOI offer funding to help with student travel to conferences when they are presenting.  See.https://mit.whoi.edu/academics/policies/conference-travel-funding..  Advisors should introduce students to colleagues and program mangers from funding agencies at meetings, as well as when colleagues or program managers visit the home institution..Each year students and advisors should discuss career goals (which may evolve). Advisors should offer advice to students on postdoc and job opportunities, and encourage the student to think broadly about his/her career..Advisors should encourage and assist with publication of results including advice on appropriate journals; structure, length and content of articles; appropriate analyses and graphics; and guidance in responding to reviewers..Advisors should provide timely feedback (e.g., within a week or two, with an idea of the timing provided by the advisor) as students write up results for their theses..Students are expected to use "MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science & Engineering, Cambridge and Woods Hole, MA, USA" as their affiliation in all publications and products stemming from their research in the Joint Program. Additional student affiliations (e.g. MIT or WHOI department) are up to the authors..In addition to the Educational Coordinator, Associate Dean, Dean, MIT Director of the Joint Program, and Joint Committee members, the Department Chair at WHOI and Department Head at MIT are go-to people for graduate students who need advice or assistance on important professional matters such as resolving conflicts or other issues with their advisors or others in the department.  MIT and WHOI also have Ombuds persons.https://www.whoi.edu/who-we-are/about-us/people/ombuds/.and.http://web.mit.edu/ombud.*There may be some discipline-specific variations to these general guidelines – see discipline handbooks.June 23, 2022.Related Links.Common Values on the Graduate Student Experience.MIT Graduate Policies & Procedures.Best Practices in Graduate Advising.All graduate students need to complete and remain up-to-date on safety training at both MIT and WHOI:.MIT Safety Training.WHOI Safety Training.All graduate students need to complete the online Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training program available on the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) web site using the link below by the end of their second year in the program:.Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training.MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Requirements.Students enter the Joint Program in Marine Geology and Geophysics with a wide range of backgrounds and eventually embark on thesis research in a wide variety of fields of study. The program is flexible, with an emphasis on reaching academic milestones rather than on the path taken..1st summer.Participating in the summer program before the first year is strongly recommended. Students start with the annual.Jake Peirson Summer Cruise.. Then students begin a research project that may become one of their General Exam projects. There are also many opportunities to attend seminars and to meet with WHOI scientists and become familiar with their research..1st and 2nd years.Students work on obtaining general knowledge of the field of marine geology and geophysics, specific knowledge in the area of their thesis research, and research experience. Prior to the beginning of the first semester, students meet with their academic advisors from both WHOI and MIT to determine a series of classes that will provide the breadth and depth of knowledge necessary for a productive researcher. See.Curriculum.for more details..Students are expected to carry out two independent research projects that form the basis of the General Exam at the beginning of the third year. The breadth of research experiences varies from student to student, but all are encouraged to use these projects as an opportunity to experience different fields and techniques in marine geology and geophysics. The ideal combination of projects:.Represents two different fields in marine geology and geophysics.Involves different approaches to the solution of problems.Includes supervision by two different advisors.Is conducted at the two different institutions.General exam.At the beginning of the third year, each student's preparation for thesis work is tested through a general examination. Students present the two independent research projects they have conducted and answer questions designed to assess the students' general background knowledge in marine geology and geophysics..After the exam, students prepare and present the research topics they have selected for thesis work..3rd through 5th years.Students complete a thesis under the supervision of a thesis advisor and thesis committee. At the end of the fifth year, each student presents and defends the thesis research for completion of a doctoral degree..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine..Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it. Start by understanding basic circuits. Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it. This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits..After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems. Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430. I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish..But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming. You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems..Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering. LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects..Upvote.·.99.76.9.5.Konanur Lakshminarayana.Former Former Professor and HOD, APSCE (2017–2020).·.Author has.3.8K.answers and.8.5M.answer views.·.5y.Related.Can I do an M.Tech in mechanical after a B.Tech in mechatronics engineering?.Yes, definitely you can proceed further and nobody can stop you doing M Tech (mechanical)..However, Post Graduation is (usually) meant for having vertical growth..But you should remember that you are going to do M Tech in.General topic.after completing undergraduate course in a.Specialization topic...Sources of picture: Google images..Continue Reading.Yes, definitely you can proceed further and nobody can stop you doing M Tech (mechanical)..However, Post Graduation is (usually) meant for having vertical growth..But you should remember that you are going to do M Tech in.General topic.after completing undergraduate course in a.Specialization topic...Sources of picture: Google images..Upvote.·.9.2.Swamy Krishna.Ex Principal of Thakur College, Lead Instructor at.Oman Air.(2010–present).·.Author has.11.4K.answers and.5.2M.answer views.·.6y.Related.After doing a B.Tech, can we go for mechatronics engineering?.After doing B.Tech Mechanical Engineering you can go for Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering..The Mechanical Engineering department at IIT Kanpur has a strong flavor of core disciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach to research and learning that strikes a unique balance of trend-setting research, challenging coursework and real-world impact that is highly respected around the world..The departm.Continue Reading.After doing B.Tech Mechanical Engineering you can go for Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering..The Mechanical Engineering department at IIT Kanpur has a strong flavor of core disciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach to research and learning that strikes a unique balance of trend-setting research, challenging coursework and real-world impact that is highly respected around the world..The department of Mechanical Engineering offers Master of Technology (M.

Technologies.Halogenated1′-methyl-1,2′-bipyrroles (MBPs) in the Northwestern Atlantic.Areas of Study.Air-Sea Gas Exchange.Air-sea gas exchange focuses on the exchange of chemical species across the air-water interface.  Processes of interest include surface wave dynamics, mixed layer physics, oceanic evaporation and precipitation, atmosphere and ocean coupled boundary layers, as well as the physical properties of gases.  Methodological approaches range from small-scale studies, often involving novel sensing systems, to regional campaigns involving often more than one oceanographic research vessel, to global observations from space.  The field data and remote sensing observations form the basis for modeling studies that feed regional and global climate and ecosystem models..Faculty:.Dave Glover.,.Bill Jenkins.,.David Nicholson.,.Z.Aleck Wang.Ocean (Bio)geochemical Fluxes and Processes.Ocean and global biogeochemical cycling is a major research focus for many faculty.  Individual studies span environments from the open-ocean and coastal systems, to rivers, estuaries and wetlands.  Methodological approaches encompass field, mesocosm, and laboratory studies, model assessments of marine biological productivity, and systematic, often long-term surveys of ocean processes along the U.S. east coast shelf and slope and estuarine settings.  This field has also benefited from the burgeoning ‘omics and bioinformatics revolutions to measure and interpret the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of the microbial community that drives biogeochemical cycles..Faculty:.Ed Boyle, Ken Buesseler.,.Matt Charette.,.Stephanie Dutkiewicz, Mick Follows, Valier Galy.,.Dave Glover.,.Colleen Hansel.,.Bill Jenkins.,.Liz Kujawinski.,.Tracy Mincer.,.David Nicholson.,.Dan Repeta.,.Mak Saito.,.Benjamin Van Mooy.,.Scott Wankel.,.Aleck Wang.,.Meg Tivey.Deep Ocean Sedimentation & Diagenetic Processes.The deep ocean forms the long-term repository of particles from land and the surface ocean that survive the transport and remineralization through the water column.  The settling process can be observed by means of moored and free-floating “sediment traps”, or by in-situ sampling with large-volume pumps.  Deep-sea sediments also record inputs from hydrothermal vents, benthic organism, as well as extraterrestrial matter settling through the water column.  Reactive mineral surfaces scavenge metals dissolved in seawater and preserve records of the chemical and isotopic composition of seawater.  The accumulating sediments undergo diagenetic changes that alter their composition and that of interstitial fluids..Faculty:.Valier Galy, Colleen Hansel, Bill Martin, Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink, Scott Wankel.Land-Ocean Interactions.The land-ocean boundary is a highly reactive, porous interface with bi-directional transport and exchange.  Processes include landward transport of sea-spray and sea-salt aerosols, delivery of land-derived aerosols to the air-sea interface, exchange of submarine groundwater – fresh and saline – along the coastlines, tidal processes that influence low-lying ecosystems in marshes, deltas and ocean islands, as well as unidirectional flow of freshwater with its dissolved and particulate load through rivers and their subsurface estuaries.  Sediments and biogenic material accumulating along this interface undergo complex changes, but preserve a valuable record of past environmental conditions..Faculty:.Matt Charette.,.Valier Galy.,.Konrad Hughen.,.Liz Kujawinski.,.Bill Martin.,.Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink.,.Dan Repeta.,.Amanda Spivak.,.Scott Wankel.,.Z. Aleck Wang.Coastal Processes.Coastal processes concern the interaction of the land with the coastal ocean and includes the exchange of coastal waters with groundwater, biogeochemical processing in the near-shore environment, coupling of coastal processes with the open ocean and anthropogenic effects on the near-shore environment..Faculty:.Amy Apprill, Ed Boyle, Matt Charette, Valier Galy, Colleen Hansel, Harry Hemond, Chris Reddy, Amanda Spivak, Aleck Wang, Scott Wankel.Ocean Circulation and Ventilation.This research area is concerned with the movement of water masses in the ocean at all scales and the way their physical and chemical properties are shaped by the interaction with the atmosphere.  The interdisciplinary nature of this field is reflected by strong interactions with the field of Physical Oceanography, remote sensing observations and ocean-wide observatories that are operated by national and international consortia and include autonomous vehicles designed and operated by, for example, members of the Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering..Faculty:.Bill Jenkins.,.David Nicholson.Hydrothermal Processes.The interior of the Earth interacts with the oceans at divergent and convergent plate boundaries the are loci of mineral deposits, biologic communities that derive their energy from sources other than sunlight, and sources and sinks for many elements that are important to biogeochemical processes in the ocean.  Fluids, rocks and minerals preserve temporal records of hydrothermal and metamorphic processes that can be deciphered through chemical analyses and geochemical modeling..Faculty:.Ed Boyle,Bill Jenkins,Frieder Klein.,.Mark Kurz, Mak Saito, Jeff Seewald.,.Meg Tivey.,.Scott Wankel.Global Biogeochemical Cycles.The cycling and transformation of compounds, elements and their isotopes between biogeochemical reservoirs is an intensely interdisciplinary research area involving investigations at all temporal and spatial scales.  Though field observations form the backbone of many studies, integration of such observations with increasingly sophisticated computer models of biogeochemical cycles advances our understanding of past and future changes in those global cycles..Faculty:.Ed Boyle, Ken Buesseler.,.Dan Cziczo,Stephanie Dutkiewicz, Mick Follows, Valier Galy.,.Harry Hemond, Konrad Hughen.,.David McGee, Shuhei Ono, Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink.,.Dan Repeta, Dan Rothman, Benjamin Van Mooy, Z. Aleck Wang.Paleoclimatology/Paleochemistry/Paleo- & Geobiology.The main focus in this area is the co-evolutions of the ocean's role in earth's climate, chemistry and biology.  Joint Program faculty, staff, and students have diverse interests, including defining and addressing problems in these fields, modeling the general circulation and past state of the ocean, atmosphere and biosphere, using the genome record, fossil DNA, biomarkers and fossils in the sedimentary record to reconstruct past ocean conditions, ocean paleo-chemistry and –biology..Faculty:.Kristine Bergmann,Tanja Bosak, Sam Bowring, Ed Boyle, Greg Fournier,Valier Galy, Konrad Hughen.,.Mark Kurz.,.David McGee, Shuhei Ono, Mak Saito, Roger Summons.Anthropogenic Chemicals & Radioisotopes in the Ocean.This research area focuses on environmental factors that govern the processes that determine the sources, transformations and fates of natural and anthropogenic compounds (both organic and inorganic), elements and isotopes in natural and engineered systems.  Examples are the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan, and the fate of anthropogenic halogenated organic compounds released from industry to rivers and coastal environments..Faculty:.Amy Apprill.,.Ed Boyle,Ken Buesseler.,.Matt Charette.,.Phil Gschwend.,.Colleen Hansel, Harry Hemond, Konrad Hughen.,.Liz Kujawinski.,.Bill Martin.,.Chris Reddy.,.Amanda Spivak, Ben Van Mooy.Marine Natural Products.The enormous diversity of life in the ocean and competition for resources brings with it diverse chemical adaptations – often in form of “secondary metabolites” - to successfully defend against predation or overgrowth by competing species, effectively communicate with each other, or secure prey and nutrients.  Many of these naturally produced compounds may have implications for human health, linking marine research to applications in the biomedical field..Faculty:.Liz Kujawinski, Tracy Mincer.,.Chris Reddy.,.Dan Repeta.,.Mak Saito.,.Ben Van Mooy.Marine Microbial Biogeochemistry and Biochemistry.The cycling of many key elements and molecules is strongly influenced by microbial communities.  The complexity of these interactions in the modern oceans is being unraveled using the latest chemical, biochemical, and microbiological techniques, including mass spectrometry-based proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolics, DNA and RNA sequencing techniques, and cultivation and physiological studies.  Connecting biochemical reactions, including the enzymes and molecules involved, to global biogeochemical processes, and their susceptibility to natural and anthropogenic influences are areas of active research..Faculty.: Amy Apprill, Colleen Hansel, Elizabeth Kujawinski, Tracy Mincer, Mak Saito, Dan Repeta, Benjamin Van Mooy.Polar Research.Polar regions play a crucial role in ocean circulation and biogeochemical processes.  In summer months, polar waters support massive stocks of phytoplankton, which fuel a dynamic and complex food web that includes some of the ocean’s most treasured and most threatened sea creatures.  It is in these regions that the densest waters are produced, which then sink to great depths and fill the abyssal oceans. The interaction of the high latitudes with the subpolar regions is crucial for many climate issues, including meltwater generation from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and the role of sea glaciers play in biogeochemical and physical processes..Faculty:.Matt Charette, Colleen Hansel, Benjamin Van Mooy, Mak Saito, Z.

OAE is a carbon dioxide removal approach that enhances the ocean’s natural ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere, which is a critical part of Earth’s carbon cycle and a moderating influence on climate change. The project is a collaboration with Drs..Robert Todd (WHOI).,.Adam Subhas (WHOI).,.Yui Takeshita (MBARI).and.Kasia Zaba (Marine Robotic Vehicles - Systems LLC).and will be closely coordinated with the LOC-NESS project led by Dr. Subhas (.locness.whoi.edu.). The team will use five ocean gliders to track alkalinity released by a field trial in the Gulf of Maine. The gliders will track a patch of seawater with elevated alkalinity and ‘tagged’ with an inert dye and monitor changes in pH. Ultimately, the project seeks to develop robust methodologies for quantifying ocean carbon uptake and ecological feedbacks using autonomous underwater systems and sensors. Applicants from a wide range disciplinary and demographic backgrounds are encouraged to apply. Strong quantitative skills and training in chemical, physical or earth science and/or engineering are desired..Drs..Malcolm Scully.,.Anna Michel.and.David (Roo) Nicholson.are seeking a doctoral student to be part of an NSF-funded study entitled “Physical Control of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Flux in Estuaries.” This highly interdisciplinary project seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of how physical and biogeochemical processes interact in estuaries to modulate atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. We will make unprecedented measurements of the spatial and temporal variations in pCO2 and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Hudson River estuary from a moored array and from ship-based surveys, to resolve variability in the along- and across-estuary directions. These measurements will include both the surface and sub-surface distribution of dissolved gases, and their distribution will be related to variations in vertical density stratification and estuarine circulation. Direct covariance atmospheric CO2 flux and water column turbulence measurements will be made from a fixed tower that spans the air-sea interface at a location where near surface turbulence is likely impacted by wind, waves, and tides, and is significantly modified by variations in vertical density stratification. These data will provide a quantitative model for the gas transfer velocity, which will be used to estimate atmospheric fluxes from the spatially resolved measurements of surface pCO2. The proposed measurements will address two long-standing research needs that contribute to the large uncertainties in estuarine CO2 emissions: 1) spatial and temporal heterogeneity in surface pCO2 values, and 2) poorly constrained gas transfer velocities. The proposed research addresses these two fundamental uncertainties, both of which are strongly modulated by physical processes, and a new conceptual model for gas exchange that is hypothesized to be applicable to a wide range of estuaries will be tested. This project will include extensive field work on the Hudson River in both 2024 and 2025.  We welcome students from physical oceanography, chemical oceanography, applied ocean physics, and engineering..Arctic coastal zones are experiencing especially rapid changes due to the loss of sea ice cover, which has increased the duration of wave exposure and strength of wave energy reaching the coast..Dr. Maddie Smith.is seeking a doctoral student to participate in research to understand the impact of waves on new ice formation in the fall, which plays a critical role in the coupled Arctic coastal system and coastline buffering. This work would include a research cruise in the Alaskan Arctic with collaborators at Oregon State University and the University of Washington. Previous field experience is not necessary; students from diverse background are encouraged to apply..Drs. Julia Guimond, Christopher Piecuch, and Catherine Walker are seeking a doctoral student to start in the Summer or Fall of 2023 and work on a project entitled “Global High-Resolution Estimates and Projections of Vertical Land Motion Using Observation-Informed Statistical Model”. The project will involve collaboration with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (in collaboration with Dr. Benjamin Hamlington) and NOAA National Ocean Service (in collaboration with Dr. William Sweet). The goal of the project is to use observations and models to better constrain past and future coastal subsidence and land loss, which worsen the effects of sea-level rise. The student will have the opportunity to gain experience with Bayesian methods as well as remote sensing, in-situ data, proxy records in the context of sea level and coastal impacts..Dr. Catherine Rychert is seeking a graduate student to work on a funded NSF project entitled, ".Mantle Dynamics and Plate Tectonics Constrained by Converted and Reflected Seismic Wave Imaging Beneath Hotspots.,” for summer or fall 2024 enrolment in the Woods Hole - MIT joint program. The student will use novel techniques to image mantle seismic discontinuities beneath a classic continental hotspot - Yellowstone, a classic oceanic hotspot -Hawaii, and a non-hotspot, beneath the Atlantic. Discontinuities of particular interest include the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and the mantle transition zone. Imaging results will be compared with experimental predictions for material properties to achieve a better understanding of Earth’s interior dynamics in these exciting places. This work is in collaboration with Peter Shearer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography..Dr. Catherine Rychert and Dr. Nicholas Harmon are seeking a graduate student to work on an NSF project entitled, ".Origin and Evolution of the Oceanic Lithosphere at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.,” for summer or fall 2024 enrolment in the Woods Hole - MIT joint program. The student will use novel techniques to image the mantle using a unique broadband ocean bottom seismic dataset. The student will perform joint inversions of different types of seismic and/or magnetotelluric datasets to achieve a synoptic view of mantle and crustal dynamics in the region. A step increase in our understanding of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system will be achieved via comparisons to other oceanic datasets. There are also broad implications for climate and hazard..Dr. Catherine Rychert and Dr. Nicholas Harmon are seeking a graduate student to work on an NSF project entitled, ".Geophysical and geochemical investigation of links between Earth’s deep and shallow volatile cycles.,” for summer or fall 2024 enrolment in the Woods Hole - MIT joint program. The student will use a new SS precursor imaging approach to image mantle transition zone, the gatekeeper of the mantle, to determine mantle flow patterns. Links with geochemistry will provide a wholistic and interdisciplinary view of the volatile cycles of the Earth. This in turn has broad implications for our understanding of climate and hazard. The project is in collaboration with Katie Kelley at University of Rhode Island..Dr Catherine Rychert and Dr. Nicholas Harmon are seeking a graduate student to work on an NSF project entitled, “.Disentangling oceanographic and solid Earth signals for a better understanding of tectonics, hazard, and climate.”, for summer or fall 2024 enrollment in the Woods Hole – MIT joint program. The oceans and the solid-Earth are intricately linked, but typically studied separately. The student will use a comprehensive suite of mooring full water depth oceanographic data and high precision ocean bottom pressure data from the RAPID/MOCA and MOVE mooring arrays to study geodetic seafloor motions and their influence on observational constraints of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slow-down. This project provides a better understanding of the “pulse” of climate change and vertical tectonic motions associated with active plate tectonics and earthquake hazard at the MOVE array in the Lesser Antilles. This project is in conjunction with Matthias Lankhorst and Uwe Send at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and international partners at the National Oceanography Center, UK and University of Hamburg, Germany..The following are examples of research projects that were available to new students for the 2022-2023 academic year.  Research projects available for the 2023-2024 academic year will be added soon..Applied Ocean Science and Engineering.The.MSEAS group.at MIT has graduate student positions available. Our research vision is to develop and transform ocean modeling, data assimilation and inference schemes to quantify regional ocean dynamics on multiple scales. Our group creates and utilizes new models and methods for multiscale modeling, uncertainty quantification, data assimilation and the guidance of autonomous vehicles. We then apply these advances to better understand physical, acoustical and biological interactions. Our environment is collaborative within a lively group of students and researchers. We seek both fundamental and applied contributions to build knowledge and benefit society. Our present research projects are outlined here:.http://mseas.mit.edu/research.and our recent publications here.http://mseas.mit.edu/publications...Biological Oceanography.check back.Chemical Oceanography.Subduction zones are the interface between Earth’s interior (crust and mantle) and exterior (atmosphere and oceans), where carbon and other volatile elements are actively moved between terrestrial reservoirs by plate tectonics..Dr. Pete Barry.is seeking a doctoral student to study the volcanic fluid and gas emissions in the Andean Convergent Margin (ACM). Specifically, a position is available on an NSF funded project to gain a better understanding of the deep carbon cycle and natural carbon sequestration processes in Earth’s crust. This project will characterize the extent of mineralogical and biological carbon sequestration along the geologically well-studied ACM, using an integrated isotope approach (noble gases and stable isotopes). Extensive field campaigns and mass spectrometry work will be a cornerstone of this project.  More information on the Barry Lab and the research group can be found at.https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/pbarry/.Deep ocean circulation plays a key role in global climate change over a range of timescales, and neodymium (Nd) isotopes have the potential to trace these processes..Dr. Sophie Hines.is seeking a doctoral student to investigate the mechanisms that set the Nd isotopic composition of North Atlantic Deep Water, a global Nd isotopic endmember that is implicated in major climate transitions in the past. This position is part of an NSF-funded project (with collaborators at University of Delaware and California State University Bakersfield) that will involve a research cruise to the Labrador Sea. In addition, the student will be trained in trace metal chemistry and mass spectrometry. Students from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply. More information can be found at.hineslab.whoi.edu...Ono laboratory for Stable Isotope Geochemistry.(based at MIT) is seeking a doctoral student to join the team to explore rock weathering as a sink of carbon dioxide. Burning fossil fuels and the cement industry adds approximately 30 Gt CO2 per year. Weathering rocks is a natural process that consumes about 1.5Gt of CO2 per year. The project seems to investigate a way to accelerate rock weathering as part of a mitigation strategy for increasing atmospheric CO2. The student would design and test biological and chemical catalysts, and conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the rates of mineral carbonation..Marine Geology and Geophysics.Dr. Veronique Le Roux.is seeking a doctoral student to be part of an NSF-funded interdisciplinary study (collaboration with Scripps and BC) on water/volatiles in lower crustal cumulates from arc settings. The student will be primarily trained in using and developing secondary ion mass spectrometry techniques and other geochemical techniques (e.g., SEM-EDS, LA-ICP-MS, EPMA etc.), with opportunities to contribute to discussion related to rheology and numerical modeling of crustal foundering, as part of the larger collaborative project. The goal is to use exposed terranes of lower crustal cumulates to determine the water contents of arc roots and primary arc magmas, building on novel results from our preliminary study. The Le Roux lab strongly encourages people of diverse backgrounds to reach out and apply..Dr. Catherine Rychert.is seeking one or more graduate students to work on an NSF funded project entitled, "Mantle Dynamics and Plate Tectonics Constrained by Converted and Reflected Seismic Wave Imaging Beneath Hotspots,” for summer or fall 2023 enrolment in the Woods Hole - MIT joint program. The student will use novel techniques to image mantle seismic discontinuities beneath a classic continental hotspot - Yellowstone, a classic oceanic hotspot -Hawaii, and a non-hotspot, beneath the Atlantic. Discontinuities of particular interest include the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and the mantle transition zone. Imaging results will be compared with experimental predictions for material properties to achieve a better understanding of Earth’s interior dynamics in these exciting places. This work is in collaboration with Peter Shearer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography..Drs..Veronique Le Roux.and.Andrew Cross.are seeking a doctoral student to work on an NSF-funded project entitled.“Strength of the Oceanic Lower Crust: New Experimental and Microstructural Constraints”.. The project will involve high-pressure laboratory deformation experiments on aggregates of plagioclase and clinopyroxene at Brown University (in collaboration with Dr. Greg Hirth), and microstructural and geochemical analyses of lower crustal rocks from the Southwest Indian Ridge, using SEM, EBSD, EPMA, and LA-ICP-MS methods. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to determine how ductile deformation, and the strength of the oceanic lower crust, influence the nucleation and longevity of detachment faulting along ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. The student will also have the opportunity to help develop numerical models of oceanic detachment faulting and mid-ocean spreading in collaboration with researchers at Boston College (led by Dr. Mark Behn)..Physical Oceanography.Dr. Amala Mahadevan.is seeking a doctoral student for the following project..Quantitative approaches for oceanic microbial ecosystems and carbon cycling.Oceanic ecosystems are crucial for the ocean’s biological pump and the sequestration of carbon. However, the diversity of microbial organisms and nonliving organic matter is so large, that it is difficult to exhaustively include processes that affect the cycling of carbon. We are limited in our knowledge of rates of transfer (growth/ decay) of carbon pools and organisms and the models that we design are sensitive to these. We also face the challenge of representing physical processes at small scales (from centimeters to meters) and environmental variability (from tens of meters to kilometer scales) in global carbon cycle models. Further, the organisms and microbial communities respond to ocean transport and physics. Hence, new approaches are needed to deal with the diversity of function and process, as well as scale, in models for microbial ecosystems and the carbon cycle. The PhD student will explore mathematically tractable approaches to modeling the complexity of oceanic microbial ecosystems, so as to make progress in understanding the carbon cycle, which is intrinsic to the earth’s climate. The research will be interdisciplinary, including physical oceanography, mathematics and microbial biology, There will be opportunities for field work and collaboration with other scientists on the project.

Mechanical engineering devices have enjoyed union with electronics controls for about a Century. It is NOT clear that an entirely new engineering discipline is needed for this area although the union of the previous disciplines is getting more compledx..As far back as the 1950s, Aero & Astro, ME, and EE required Subjects in each others' Departments and taught shared disciplines. I know this because I was there (Class of 1960)..So, when Mechatronics develops into a truly separate engineering discipline, re-post this Question..And before someone thinks of me as being opposed to progress, a side comment. The MIT Dept of Aero & Astro celebrates THREE birthdays. The first MIT Degree granted in Aeronautical Engineering was before WW I (1914 IIRC). The Aero Dept achieved total separation from the ME Dept and became a totally separate engineering discipline just before WW II (1940 IIRC). I attended the special Celebration Dinner commemorating both events. The THIRD BIRTHDAY? The Class of 1960 was the first anywhere in the world to receive degrees in Astronautics with the change of the Department Name to Dept of Aeronautics & Astroncomplex..So, I feel that RIGHT NOW Mechatronics is still a “buzz-word.” For now, completing Subjects in ME, EE, and whatever else is appropriate is adequate PROVIDED that the Faculty teaches these areas in a unified manner….. which is what the MIT Faculty has done for decades..Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards.

With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back.

define a course of study for their first two years with the assistance of an Academic Advisory Committee of their choosing.  The course of study includes at least 96 units of non-research courses (about 8 courses)..Most of the course work is accomplished during the first and second years. The core oceanography curriculum includes Biological Oceanography (course number 7.47) and Foundational statistics/quantitative methods in data analysis and modeling, and at least 24 additional units of graduate-level oceanography or marine science.  In addition, students are encouraged to include Topics courses among their non-research course credits..The Topics courses are short (1.5 h/wk), but advanced, lecture and discussion courses in specific areas of biological oceanography. Students are expected to take additional courses in areas within and outside Biology, as appropriate for their specific research directions. The curriculum has built-in flexibility to allow students to build depth of knowledge in their specific area of study, and to add breadth to their understanding of biological oceanography..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Much is learned from listening to and working with other graduate students. Both Joint Program offices (at MIT and Woods Hole) "feel personal." Staff know the students and are quick to move on issues that need solving..On both campuses, students have the resources of a world-class research institution at their fingertips. They talk of the value of being around colleagues who are studying the same interdisciplinary problems from other angles. Cross-pollination of ideas creates a buzz of excitement in hallways and at lunch tables..Harvard's cooperative agreement with MIT means you have the opportunity to classes at another world-class university just down the street (literally). Beyond the arrangement that allows for cross-registration, some students conduct collaborative research with Harvard faculty and may include them on their doctoral committees..Community.Polar bear swims, pig parties, intramural sports, donut hours at the WHOI student center, volunteer science coaching... students have many opportunities to build community within the Joint Program, within their MIT departments, and across disciplines..Sports, both organized and informal, are favorite after work and lunchtime activities. There are intramural teams through MIT departments and the Joint Program, pickup soccer and volleyball games, track practice every week, and regular nights of volleyball or racquetball at the Falmouth Sports Center or the MIT gym. WHOI has an intramural softball league with a dozen teams. The coastline offers opportunities for fun as well as science: many students windsurf, kayak, sail, and swim..WHOI employees and students maintain a community WHOI WIKI page, an online hub for all WHOI employees and students to share non-scientific, everyday life information in the Woods Hole/Falmouth area. It covers automotive, childcare, fitness and recreation, healthcare, home/apartment, restaurants, LGBT, local accomodations, outreach, pet care, public transportation, restaurants, services, sustainable living, and WHOI perks. Please fill out the Contact/Submit form on the WHOI WIKI page if you have information/resources that you think should be included or updated..The MIT Graduate Student Council runs several committees focused on housing/community affairs, social get-togethers, fund-raising, and talks. Yet another option is a department-specific student organization such as the EAPS Graduate Student Advisory Council (EGSAC), which organizes activities for EAPS graduate students. The MIT Biology department has a similar organization called Bio99..Going to sea—whether for the summer sail for first-year students or to conduct research—forges community in a relatively short, intense period. Joint Program students share their excitement for ocean science with local junior high and high school students by volunteering to teach Science Club, as science fair judges, serving as coaches for independent science projects, and participating in the regional competition of the National Ocean Science Bowl as judges and timekeepers..Students participate in the social activities of their MIT departments when they are in Cambridge. In addition, the Joint Program has its own unique social calendar, kicked off by a gala at the beginning of the year..Managing the Commute.Regular bus service joins MIT and Woods Hole during the school year, and the program covers the costs. The bus runs from MIT to WHOI on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and returns in the afternoon. This allows students who live in the Cambridge area to take classes at WHOI (which are generally held on Tuesdays and Thursdays) and to participate in other WHOI-based activities. The program reimburses students for necessary travel between institutions via public or private transportation on days the dedicated JP bus isn’t running..In addition, the program has.a car.for students to borrow for the trip and offers subsidized Boston bus and subway passes. While you do not need to have a car to be in this program, public transportation within Cape Cod is limited, and a car is often useful..Apartments are available., if you need to stay for a few days at one location or the other..The bottom line is that students do not incur any costs commuting between the two campuses for Joint Program purposes..Finding Housing.Housing can be particularly tight in the small village of Woods Hole. That is one reason why WHOI owns residential properties in the Woods Hole/Falmouth community. The WHOI Housing Office provides these residences for use by students and guests of the Institution. Student needs are the priority throughout the year. Policies regarding student access to housing are described.here...MIT also provides help finding housing near the Cambridge campus. Go to the.Department of Housing web page.for more information..Attending seminars and classes.Both MIT and WHOI attract a multitude of top-notch researchers as guest lecturers. Go to the.Event Calendars.and.Seminars.sections for schedules..Students typically do not have to commute to attend classes. Instead, the program uses videoconferencing to link classrooms at MIT and WHOI..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Among such tools is the atomic force microscope (AFM) for nanoscale imaging and surface characterization. An AFM scans a micro-cantilever over the sample surface to measure various quantities from the probe-sample interaction. With high-speed imaging, dynamic processes can be visualized to improve fundamental understanding of microscopic interactions. Scientists can use videos, in addition to images, to observe and compare experimental data with theoretical predictions, and verify models without speculating about intermediate dynamics. However, conventional AFMs have limited throughput that allow for static imaging only and require transparent working environments..The contributions of this work remove such AFM restrictions and enable advanced visualization capabilities. Example applications include visualizing chemical reactions and biological responses in their native environments. To this end, the thesis addresses four main AFM limitations. These are (i) increase the low imaging throughput to be compatible for higher temporal resolution imaging, (ii) remove the transparency requirement, for AFMs that use optical beam deflection sensing, and enable imaging in harsh opaque liquids, (iii) establish automation algorithms to reduce operational overheads associated with experiment setup and controller tuning, and (iv) introduce custom design modifications resulting in affordable AFMs for engineering education..These new capabilities are primarily enabled with the development of new subsystems. The key components include nano-positioners, cantilever probes, and control algorithms. New generation AFM nano-positioners are designed with high-speed, large-range or low-cost characteristics for different scanning needs. Coated active cantilever probes are developed for AFM imaging in specialized opaque environments. Multiple algorithms for scanner control, automatic tuning, and image formation are investigated to improve AFM imaging performance. Additional developments to support AFM imaging include high-bandwidth driver electronics, optical systems with vision-based automation, and software implementation for AFM big data processing. Three AFM systems are integrated using these new subsystems for different applications. They include a versatile sample scan AFM for overview-and-zoom imaging in air and liquids, a multi-layer stacked scanner AFM for high-speed and large-range imaging in air, and a low-cost active probe AFM for engineering education. AFM images and videos at 20 frames per second are taken in various environments to verify the new capabilities. These developments have broader impacts in the fields of precision instrumentation, nano-fabrication, and nano-scale process video-rate visualization..The main susbsystem level contributions involved in this work include:.1) high-speed and large-range AFM nano-positioner design.2) imaging algorithms for scanner control and sampling.3) optical system for small probes with automation.4) coated active cantilever probes for opaque liquid operation.5) high-bandwidth driver and signal conditioning electronics.6) software implementation of high-speed data processing.7) AFM system integration for dynamic process visualization..The AFM development extends the capabilities of current AFM systems in various aspects. The research also has broader impacts in the fields of precision instrumentation, nano-fabrication and chemical or biological process visualization.

It was started by graduate students who wanted to lower the barrier for an often confusing and complicated graduate school application process. We offer mentorship to both prospective PhD and Navy Masters students. We are focused on providing advice and support to potential students who are underrepresented at and/or unfamiliar to MIT, WHOI, or ocean sciences This includes but is not limited to:.applicants who are the first in their family to apply to graduate school.members of groups underrepresented in ocean sciences and engineering.applicants with financial hardship.non-traditional students, including those with caregiving responsibilities, switching fields of study, and/or returning to school after working full-time.When is the JP ASK program active?.September 1 to December 1...Mentors are not guaranteed and will be matched on a rolling basis, so we encourage you to sign up as soon as possible and be as specific as possible in your answers. Responses after the December 1 deadline are accepted but may not provide enough time for constructive feedback before the December 15 application deadline..What type of guidance is available?.Current graduate student volunteers can:.answer questions about the MIT-WHOI curriculum and learning environment.share their perspectives of living in Cambridge and/or on Cape Cod.provide advice on the overall graduate application process.discuss how you may fit in the JP community.answer other graduate school related questions.How do I sign up for the program?.To sign up,.click here!.If this does not work, go to.https://forms.gle/oqeQucfKryWw39Eg9...What other resources are available?.The JP ASK program is run by current graduate student volunteers and is a supplement to your undergraduate, personal, and professional networks, as well as online resources like the.Pathways to Science resource toolbox.. Please make sure to take advantage of those resources as well..Additionally, Joint Program students publish a newsletter called.Through the Porthole.aimed at prospective students. Some useful articles include suggestions about how to get involved in.undergraduate research., a perspective on.paths to graduate school., some reflections on the.application process from current students., advice for.cold-emailing scientists.,.tips on writing.a.personal statement., and recommendations for.how to choose a graduate program...Will participation in the program impact admissions decisions?.No..JP ASK volunteers are not involved in any aspect of the admission process and are acting solely as a source of advice and support for those unfamiliar with MIT, WHOI, or navigating the process of applying to graduate programs in oceanography.

The standalone CSE PhD program is intended for students who intend to pursue research in cross-cutting methodological aspects of computational science. The resulting doctoral degree in Computational Science and Engineering is awarded by CCSE via the the Schwarzman College of Computing. In contrast, the interdisciplinary CSE PhD program is intended for students who are interested in computation in the context of a specific engineering or science discipline. For this reason, this degree is offered jointly with participating departments across the Institute; the interdisciplinary degree is awarded in a specially crafted thesis field that recognizes the student’s specialization in computation within the chosen engineering or science discipline..For more information about CCSE’s doctoral programs, please explore the links on the left.

They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal.

Then most of them are always working on some project and you can work under them, or you might have your own project idea and you can ask some tecaher to help with that..And, since it's an emerging field in India, they are trying their best to give students the required exposure. This brings us to the labs which have been setup with equipments from the companies like Bosch Rexroth, ABB and Siemens. We have the following labs — PLC, Sensorics, Mechatronics, Hydraulics & Pneumatics, Robotics and Drives & Control. The Robotics Lab has ABB's 6-axis IRB robot, Drives & Control Lab has PLCs and Electric Drives provided by Bosch & the Mechatronics Lab consists of a complete miniature Modular Production System with 5 stations. And, if it makes it more likeable, they are all air-conditioned :).In spite of all these positive aspects, it all gets narrowed down to Mechatronics being not so popular in India and India being not much into automation. And that, my friend, affects the placements. The companies like Tata are specifically told to recruit from the core branches like Mechanical. The highest package goes around 7–8 Lacs for Mechatronics in Manipal.

The students who passed out from my batch have obtained very good results in terms of placements, graduate schools etc. Many have careers in Mercedes and some have even made it to the ivy leagues for masters education. All of this is just from one batch, that too the one following the old curriculum..The teachers and students are very excited about the new curriculum as the individual subjects merge and provide a holistic education, which was lacking in the old one. The results of the new curriculum batch will show up next year..Also, you are in MIT, Manipal. MIT has a wonderful entrepreneurial and innovation centre that promote startup ideas and even incubate. This further bolsters the mechatronics education..Mechatronics in manipal is not a overlooked branch, many of its students handle large national award winning groups like robo manipal which manipal funds even to go international. There are plenty of clubs and groups that mechatronics students can take advantage of to amplify their education..The department is filled with young teachers and lecturers, who have the stamina and excitement to teach. They are also very loving and caring as they understand a lot what the youth goes through. They are very open to ideas and suggestions and especially new ideas/studies which people share in class. This gives students a feel that lecturers are also learning with them together..If you are a student in India interested in Mechatronics for undergrad, I feel there is no better place than Manipal. You will definitely leave with a world class education and a strong skill set..Upvote.·.99.14.9.2.Related questions.How is BTech mechatronics in MIT Manipal?

Burr Steinbach Visiting Scholars Program.In 1969, H. Burr Steinbach, serving as first Dean of graduate Studies at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, started a special program of visiting scholars specifically for the graduate students. This program, run every year since then, is intended to give our graduate students an opportunity to meet scholars working in ocean science, ocean engineering, ocean policy or in related fields leading scientists and engineers in an informal, relaxed atmosphere where the free exchange of information and ideas is promoted. The program is run entirely by graduate students in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering, with all visiting scholars determined by student interest and scheduled and hosted by students..Scheduling is primarily, but not exclusively, during the summer months, with each distinguished scholar in residence for two to three days. Each visiting scholar is asked to give a minimum of three talks and be available for consultation with individuals or small groups of interested students. Appropriate social events are organized and hosted by the students to provide opportunities for the visiting scholar to meet students and staff..During the summer there are close to 200 students in residence at WHOI. The majority is enrolled as full-time graduate students in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering. They are joined by advanced graduate students in the Summer Program in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and advanced undergraduates in our Summer Student Fellowship Program. These students come from colleges and universities across the country and around the world. The Visiting Scholars Program serves as a catalyst for bringing the students and staff members together in an atmosphere of stimulating intellectual exchange..Dr. Steinbach, more fondly remembered as "Burr," passed away in December 1981 after a long and distinguished career as a research biologist, department chairman at the University of Chicago, Director of the Marine Biological Laboratory, and Dean at WHOI (see.Dr. Steinbach’s CV (pdf).). After a great deal of thought and with the approval of the Steinbach family, it was decided to pay tribute to Burr Steinbach’s dedication to students by naming the visiting scholars program in his honor. Through the generosity of alumni, friends, colleagues, and associates, we are pleased to be able to continue this program..Past H.

She and her team had spent weeks preparing for this deployment. With only a week to work on-site, they were making use of the long summer days to collect thousands of observations of a hypothesized chemical anomaly associated with the annual ice-cover retreat..The robot moved up and down the stream, using its chemical sensors to detect the composition of the flowing water. Its many measurements revealed a short-lived but massive influx of greenhouse gases in the water during the annual “flushing” of the estuary as ice thawed and receded. For Preston, the experiment’s success was a heartening affirmation of how robotic platforms can be leveraged to help scientists understand the environment in fundamentally new ways..Growing up near the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, Preston learned about the importance of environmental conservation from a young age. She became passionate about how next-generation technologies could be used as tools to make a difference. In 2016, Preston completed her BS in robotics engineering from Olin College of Engineering..“My first research project involved creating a drone that could take noninvasive blow samples from exhaling whales,” Preston says. “Some of our work required us to do automatic detection, which would allow the drone to find the blowhole and track it. Overall, it was a great introduction on how to apply fundamental robotics concepts to the real world.”.Preston’s undergraduate research inspired her to apply for a Fulbright award, which enabled her to work at the Center for Biorobotics in Tallinn, Estonia, for nine months. There, she worked on a variety of robotics projects, such as training a robotic vehicle to.map an enclosed underwater space.. “I really enjoyed the experience, and it helped shape the research interests I hold today. It also confirmed that grad school was the right next step for me and the work I wanted to do,” she says..Uncovering geochemical hotspots.After her Fulbright ended, Preston began her PhD in aeronautics and astronautics and applied ocean physics and engineering through a joint program between MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Her co-advisors, Anna Michel and Nicholas Roy, have helped her pursue both theoretical and experimental questions. “I really wanted to have an advisor relationship with a scientist,” she says. “It was a high priority to me to make sure my work would always be a bridge between science and engineering objectives.”.“Overall, I see robots as a tool for scientists. They take knowledge, explore, bring back datasets. Then scientists do the actual hard work of extracting meaningful information to solve these hard problems,” says Preston..The first two years of her research focused on how to deploy robots in environments and process their collected data. She.developed algorithms.that could allow the robot to move on its own. “My goal was to figure out how to exploit our knowledge of the world and use it to plan optimal sampling trajectories,” says Preston. “This would allow robots to independently navigate to sample in regions of high interest to scientists.”.Improving sampling trajectories becomes a major advantage when researchers are working under limited time or budget constraints. Preston was able to deploy her robot in Massachusetts’ Wareham River to detect dissolved methane and other greenhouse gases, byproducts of a wastewater treatment chemical feedstock and natural processes. “Imagine you have a ground seepage of radiation you’re trying to characterize. As the robot moves around, it might get ‘wafts’ of the radiation,” she says..“Our algorithm would update to give the robot a new estimate of where the leak might be. The robot responds by moving to that location, collecting more samples and potentially discovering the biggest hotspot or cause for the leak. It also builds a model we can interpret along the way.” This method is a major advancement in efficient sampling in the marine geochemical sciences, since historic strategies meant collecting random bottle samples to be analyzed later in the lab..Adapting to real-world requirements.In the next phase of her work, Preston has been incorporating an important component — time. This will improve explorations that last over several days. “My previous work made this strong assumption that the robot goes in and by the time it’s done, nothing’s different about the environment. In reality this isn’t true, especially for a moving river,” she says. “We’re now trying to figure out how to better model how a space changes over time.”.This fall, Preston will be traveling on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography research vessel Roger Revelle to the Guaymas Basin the Gulf of California. The research team will be releasing remotely operated and autonomous underwater robots near the bottom of the basin to investigate how hydrothermal plumes move in the water column. Working closely with engineers from the National Deep Submergence Facility, and in collaboration with her advisers and research colleagues at MIT, Preston will be on board, directing the deployment of the devices..“I’m looking forward to demonstrating how our algorithmic developments work in practice. It’s also thrilling to be part of a huge, diverse group that’s willing to try this,” she says..Preston is just finishing her fourth year of research, and is starting to look toward the future after her PhD. She plans to continue studying marine and other climate-impacted environments. She is driven by our plethora of unexplored questions about the ocean and hopes to use her knowledge to scratch its surface. She’s drawn to the field of computational sustainability, she says, which is based on “the idea is that machine learning, artificial intelligence, and similar tools can and should be applied to solve some of our most pressing challenges, and that these challenges will in turn change how we think about our tools.”.“This is a really exciting time to be a roboticist who also cares about the environment — and to be a scientist who has access to new tools for research. Maybe I’m a little overly optimistic, but I believe we’re at a pivotal moment for exploration.”.Share.this news article on:.X.Facebook.LinkedIn.Reddit.Print.Related Links.Victoria Preston.MIT-WHOI Joint Program.Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.School of Engineering.Related Topics.Profile.Students.Graduate, postdoctoral.Aeronautical and astronautical engineering.Robots.Robotics.Oceanography and ocean engineering.Environment.Artificial intelligence.Machine learning.Algorithms.Autonomous vehicles.Computer science and technology.Sustainability.School of Engineering.Woods Hole.Related Articles.Ancient atmospheric oxygen sleuthing with ocean chromium.Autonomous system improves environmental sampling at sea.Engineers program marine robots to take calculated risks.MIT engineers hand “cognitive” control to underwater robots.Previous item.Next item.More MIT News.MIT engineers find a way to protect microbes from extreme conditions.By helping microbes withstand industrial processing, the method could make it easier to harness the benefits of microorganisms used as medicines and in agriculture..Read full story.→.Studying astrophysically relevant plasma physics.Thomas Varnish has always loved a hands-on approach to science.

For more information:.http://web.mit.edu/tlo/www/community/students.html.If you requesting that MIT waive the right to your patent (the form for this is also on the link above), you can request a thesis hold from the Dean of Undergraduate Education. A request for a thesis hold must be made jointly by the student and advisor, using the DUE Thesis Hold Request Form, which you can download from the DUE website. For more information:.http://due.mit.edu/faqs/frequently-asked-questions#Thesis_Hold.General Information.The SB in Mechanical Engineering requires a thesis with a minimum of 6 units credit. The objective of this requirement is to give students an opportunity to learn about a topic in depth through independent study under the guidance of an advisor who is knowledgeable in the field..The nature of the work may be the review of an engineering topic of interest to the student, an original research project, or a design project. In any case, the work must involve additional learning of a substantive nature. The work must be documented by a thesis document graded by the advisor. With the approval of the advisor, up to 15 units of credit are permitted..Finding a Thesis Supervisor.Students have the responsibility to find their own thesis supervisor, and it is best that this be done by the beginning of the senior year. Your thesis supervisor should be an MIT faculty member (not necessarily MechE), or an approved MechE lab instructor or researcher. Many students develop theses from UROP projects that they have had during the junior year or summer between junior and senior years. In that case, the UROP supervisor becomes the thesis supervisor. In other cases, students will contact faculty members whose research is of interest to them, and a thesis project can be developed by discussion between the student and the faculty member. In still other cases, students may have their own clear idea of the subject of their thesis, and the task will be to find a faculty member who is interested in working with the student on that topic..The thesis advisor of record must be an MIT faculty member or select members of the research staff (graduate students and postdocs are ineligible to act as thesis advisors). Students who are looking for an appropriate thesis advisor should consult the Undergraduate Office (Room 1-110). Theses may be done off campus, but students are cautioned that off-campus supervisors usually are not familiar with the thesis requirements which may put the student at risk when seeking approval of the Department. Also, work done at an industrial firm may be considered proprietary by the firm which would prevent the student from submitting the thesis to the Department. In such cases, a representative of the firm must sign a release letter, a sample text of which is available at the MechE Undergraduate Office..You can.search MechE faculty.by topic areas..Thesis Registration and Grading.Students may elect to start and/or finish the work in the Fall Term, the Spring Term, or IAP, and they may choose to extend the work over several terms. In the latter case, a progress report is required for each term of registration. If the work in progress is judged satisfactory by the advisor, a grade of "J" will be awarded. Unsatisfactory progress will be awarded the grade "U". Students must be registered for subject 2.ThU for the term in which the thesis is submitted..Before registering for thesis, students must complete the thesis proposal form and attach a brief paragraph summarizing the work planned. (The form is available on the "download forms" page in this web site.) The form must be signed by the thesis advisor and returned to the MechE Undergraduate Office (Room 1-110). In the event of a change of advisor or project, the proposal must be updated in the Undergraduate Office as soon as possible. Students who submit the completed forms on or before Registration Day may register for 2.ThU on the Registration Form for the number of units agreed upon with the thesis advisor. Students who complete the thesis proposal after Registration Day, but before the Add Date, must add 2.ThU by submitting to the Registrar a completed Add/Drop Form signed by both the thesis supervisor and the student's faculty advisor..Drop date.is the absolute deadline for adding or dropping 2.ThU. Students may not register for the thesis after the drop date..At mid-term, the thesis advisor will be asked for an assessment of the student's progress on the thesis. Thus, it is important for the student to maintain contact with the advisor so that an accurate assessment can be made. If the thesis advisor judges progress to be unsatisfactory, a grade of "U" will be submitted and the number of units for 2.ThU registration will be reduced to 1. The grade of "U" will remain on the transcript and the Course 2 degree requirements cannot be completed until another thesis is started and completed with a passing grade. Students who are making satisfactory progress but fail to complete the thesis by the Thesis Due Date will receive the grade "J" indicating that at least one additional unit of registration for 2.ThU will be required to complete the Course 2 degree. Upon satisfactory completion of the thesis, the thesis advisor will assign a grade which will apply to all units of 2.ThU registration from previous terms, up to an absolute limit of 15. For thesis credit during IAP, students should register during the first week of IAP in the Undergraduate Office..During the semester in which the student expects to graduate., it is the responsibility of the student to maintain contact with the thesis advisor. In the event that thesis progress is reported as unsatisfactory, the student's name will be removed from the Degree List. Students are reminded that graduation also can be delayed by late submission of an acceptable thesis or by submission of a thesis that fails to conform to the current Thesis Specifications. Theses may not be submitted after 5:00 PM on the Thesis Due Date..Consult the MIT Academic Calendar for Add Date, Drop Date, and Thesis Due Dates for the.semester in question...Thesis Submission.Be sure to submit a draft version of your thesis to your thesis supervisor well before the thesis due date. Your thesis supervisor may have edits for you to incorporate into your final thesis. One copy of the final thesis must be submitted to the Undergraduate Office in 1-110..1. Be sure that the thesis meets the library’s published thesis specifications, published online.here.2. Pay special attention to the title page and abstract page – examples are provided online..Title page.(required, please look at the example for formatting).Layout.Sample title page.The date on the Title Page MUST BE one of the following (this reflects the date of your degree, not the date of your thesis submission):.September 2023, February 2024 or May 2024.The Signature block should contain the following:.Signature of Author:.Department of Mechanical Engineering[Date of thesis submission].Certified by:[Your thesis advisor’s name].[Thesis advisor’s title].Thesis Supervisor Accepted by: Kenneth Kamrin.Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering.Undergraduate Officer.Abstract page.(required, please look at the example for formatting).Layout.Sample abstract.The date on the Abstract Page reflects your thesis submission date.Latex templates.The thesis specs website says: If you are writing your thesis on Athena, follow the formatting and typeface instructions under the LATEX or FRAME olc stock answer topics by typing the command "olc_answers" on any Athena workstation..General Thesis Writing Information.For formatting guidelines, please see the.Thesis Specifications...This website has information relating to required pages (title and abstract), as well as suggestions for fonts and formatting figures/graphics.

In the Mechatronics Research Lab, we have created a robot that is capable of scanning pipe walls autonomously, reporting back estimates for where leaks are located within the pipe..In addition to building this robot, we research how the pipe interior can be cleaned, and how existing leaks can be repaired without cutting access to the water supply.  In addition, we will investigate ways to instrument pipes so that they are able to detect when they are about to fail..On a larger scale, we are interested in pipe networks, developing algorithms to monitor and operate pipe networks in the most efficient manner.  We also want to develop a way to recharge robots within the pipe so they can sustain themselves for long-term missions..Categories:.Projects.,.Robot.Post navigation.←.AFM team won 2014 National Instruments Engineering Impact Awards.3D Deprinter: A Robot for Cellphone Disassembly, Repair and Recyle.→.Search for:.Recent Posts.Hydrogel.3D Deprinter: A Robot for Cellphone Disassembly, Repair and Recyle.Leak Detection System For City Water Distribution Systems.AFM team won 2014 National Instruments Engineering Impact Awards.Leak Detection.Archives.Archives.Select Month.June 2018.September 2017.March 2017.September 2014.July 2014.March 2014.January 2014.November 2013.August 2013.Categories.Control.Power.Projects.Publications.Robot.Uncategorized.Meta.Log in.Entries feed.Comments feed.WordPress.org.© 2024 Mechatronics Research Laboratory

How do I proceed after the completion of my course in 2022 because I’m looking to study an M.tech in mechatronics abroad?.Yash Trikannad.B.Tech in.Mechatronics.&.Robotics.,.Manipal University.(Graduated 2018).·.Updated 6y.·.I would disagree with the answers here..I am myself a Mechatronics Engineer from MIT batch of 2014–2018. In my last semester I interned at Addverb Technology which deals in Warehouse Automation. I got the opportunity to work in core field on subjects of path planning, image processing, navigation, etc. For development of an AGV. There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers. The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields. Basically the system as a whole..Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest. I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot. The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field. The Labs are world class. Research is a bit lagging. Practical exposure is excellent. But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc. which is gold if you love robotics..If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field. Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study. However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India..I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics. There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics..4K views.·.View upvotes.·.View 1 share.·.Answer requested by.Nimish Sahni.1 of 4 answers.View.3.other answers to this question.About.·.Careers.·.Privacy.·.Terms.·.Contact.·.Languages.·.Your Ad Choices.·.Press.·.© Quora, Inc. 2024.Please enable Javascript and refresh the page to continue

We have broken them down into areas of particular interest. We hope this helps in making your decision for graduate school. Please note if you have a question that is not answered here email us at.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu...General.Is a bachelor’s degree or equivalent required for admission?.To be admitted as a regular graduate student, an applicant must have earned a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent from a college, university, or technical school of acceptable standing. Students in their final year of undergraduate study may be admitted on the condition that their bachelor’s degree is awarded before they enroll at MIT..I want to get a Master’s Degree, not a doctoral degree.  Can I still apply to the Joint Program?.Applications are only accepted for the doctoral program.  We do not accept students who are only interested in receiving a Master’s Degree from the Joint Program. The only exception is for the agreement we have with the U.S. Navy where students are accepted only for a Master’s Degree..How long does it take to get a doctoral degree?.The Joint Program is designed for students to achieve their doctoral degree in five years..I have previously earned a Masters; how will this affect my timeline?.Depending on your discipline, students with a previous Masters are sometimes able to take fewer courses. In addition, these students often have skills and experience that allow them to make faster initial progress in their thesis research. While this may lead to a slightly shorter timeline, students most commonly take five years to complete their doctoral studies..When may I start the Joint Program?.If you accept our admission offer, you may enroll in June or September. We strongly encourage you to start in June so you can get started on your research and become familiar with Woods Hole and Cambridge, depending on the location of your adviser..Are there faculty who I can talk to about my research?.Yes, we encourage you to contact any of the faculty listed on the MIT-WHOI Joint Program website who have similar research interests to you and with whom you may want to work. You can find these listings under each field of study, or a comprehensive list of all faculty within all disciplines under “Academics”..Do I need to identify an advisor?.You are strongly encouraged to contact faculty members with similar research interests but you are not required to identify a potential advisor for admission. Here’s information about how to contact faculty members:.http://mit.whoi.edu/visitors.and here’s a list of faculty members:.http://mit.whoi.edu/faculty-staff.Are you considered an MIT or WHOI student if you are in the program?.Students in the Joint Program are members of both MIT and WHOI communities. They have equal access to resources at both institutions regardless of where they live (on WHOI’s or MIT’s campus)..Is the MIT-WHOI Joint Program the right graduate program for me?.While the Joint Program is one of the premier programs in ocean science and engineering, we acknowledge that this program may not be for everyone. Choosing the graduate school that you want to attend is an important decision because you will be dedicating at least five years to obtaining your doctoral degree. In the Joint Program, you have access to the faculty and resources at two institutions in very different locations; MIT in Cambridge, a vibrant and diverse city, and at WHOI, a seaside village on Cape Cod.  In all estimates, it is the best of both worlds.  And we are able to provide forward-looking research methods and applications to current world-wide issues..What are the graduates of the Joint Program doing now?.Many of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduates go on to postdoctoral research at an academic institution and may then remain in academia as faculty and/or researchers at both small, liberal arts schools, as well as large universities.  Among our over 1,000 graduates, we also have people working in private industry, at government labs, elsewhere in government, in policy, as U.S. Naval officers, and in their own companies that they have created..Does the Joint Program offer a part-time attendance option?.The MIT-WHOI Joint Program does not offer a part-time option.  Students who enroll in the Joint Program do so as a full-time student, and it is based on a five year program..I just want to take a Joint Program class, but am not a Joint Program student.  How do I do that?.If you would like to take a class in the Joint Program, but are not an enrolled student, you can apply to be an MIT special student (details can be found on the MIT web site at.http://web.mit.edu/registrar/reg/instructions/specialstudents.html.) or you can call the MIT Office of Admissions at (617) 253-2917..Is there an information session I can attend to learn more?.Yes.  Each year we offer an information session for prospective applicants.  We do not yet have a firm date for the 2024-2025 application cycle, but we will post it here when we do.  These sessions are offered via Zoom..Application Questions.What do I list as “Area of research or interdisciplinary program” in the application?.This is where you will list what area of research you are interested in studying.  These research areas are:  Applied Ocean Science and Engineering, Biological Oceanography, Chemical Oceanography, Marine Geology and Geophysics, Physical Oceanography..What if I am interested in more than one of the disciplines in the Joint Program?.If you are interested in more than one field, you may list up to three that you are interested in; but, please list them in order of your interest (most interested first)..Do I need to pay two application fees if applying to the Joint Program and a separate MIT department?.If you are applying to more than one department or program, you must submit separate applications and fees for each department..Do I need to mail my transcript to both MIT and WHOI?.No,.UNOFFICIAL, NON-ENCRYPTED.copies of transcripts are uploaded in the online application.  If you are admitted, you will be asked to send sealed official copies of your transcripts, and the address to which those should be sent will be given to you at that time..I attend a college or university that uses narrative evaluations of my courses rather than numerical or letter grades. What should I upload into the application?.Applicants who have attended or received credit from a college or university which evaluates coursework through narrative transcripts/evaluations rather than assigning numerical or letter grades must upload narrative evaluations for math and science courses in the transcript section of the online application..Are there any concerns about the optional Pass/No Pass grading scale that universities are offering their students during remote learning academic terms?.Our admissions committee is aware of the stresses that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and that many programs at colleges and universities across the country are recommending P/NP for some or all coursework.  We base our admissions decisions on a holistic evaluation of factors, not just grades in one semester. The factors include academic preparation and overall grades in STEM classes, GRE scores as a supplement (except for the 2021 application cycle), research experience, references, and your statement of objectives, as well as a match with potential advisors who have funding in hand for specific projects. We therefore suggest you follow recommendations of your undergraduate program and/or advisors with respect to P/NP vs letter grades..Will the GRE be required for the 2024 admissions cycle?.For the 2024 admissions cycle, GRE scores will not be required but we have not yet decided whether they may be optionally submitted as part of the Joint Program application..What is the minimum English proficiency exam score for international students applying to the Joint Program?.The minimum acceptable TOEFL score is 100 (iBT) or 600 (PBT).The minimum acceptable IELTS score is: 7.0.The minimum Cambridge English Exam Score is 185..TOEFL and IELTS scores are valid for two years..Where should I send my TOEFL scores?.Scores should be sent electronically to Institution Code: MIT 3514 and Department Code: Oceanography 75..Does the Joint Program accept TOEFL.MyBest.scores?.At this time, we are not accepting.MyBest.scores.

Instructions are.here...Unlike IELTS or TOEFL, many countries offer the Cambridge English Qualification as part of an English language course in their school curriculum. For applicants in these countries, the exam’s registration fee is waived as part of their broader educational curriculum.Can English proficiency exam.scores be submitted late?.We do accept late scores, although there is no guarantee we will receive late materials in time for them to be considered in your application review process..What if my English proficiency exam scores are expired?.If your scores are expired, you must submit new up to date scores that are active at the time of application. Do note, official scores, even if sent electronically, can take two weeks to arrive.  Please plan accordingly when scheduling your exam so that your scores arrive by the application deadline..I sent my English proficiency exam scores and they are not showing up on the application portal, what do I do?.Please note, it can take up to two weeks for English Fluency Exam scores to be received- even if sent electronically..Do I need to submit a resume?.Yes, resumes are a required part of the application that give us a better understanding of your work, research and educational background..Resume writing tips can be found here:.How to Write a Resume.Resume Writing Guide for Grad School.Can I update my statement, resume or other details?.No, once your application has been submitted and the deadline has passed, we do not accept updates on any aspect of the application..I submitted my materials in the application portal and they do not show as received, what do I do?.It can take up to 48 hours for materials to be processed and appear in the application portal..Do you interview applicants?.We do not currently interview applicants as part of the formal application process.

If your recommender encounters an issue or faces a challenge in submitting by the deadline, a letter can be submitted late.  However, review of applications starts shortly after the deadline and we cannot guarantee review of your application without the relevant materials..Who reviews my applications?.Applications are reviewed by the Dean, Associate Dean, and members of the JP Admissions Advisory Committee and the appropriate Joint Committee. A list of members of the Admissions Advisory Committee and Education Coordinators can be found here:.https://mit.whoi.edu/about/governance/admissions-advisory-committee/.When will I be notified of a decision?.Joint Program offers are normally made by mid-Feb to late February each year.  Timing of offers can depend on a number of factors, including funding and the schedules of people involved in decisions. But every effort is made to inform people by late February. If you are on a wait list, you will be notified of that as well by late February..Who will notify me regarding my application?.Emails regarding application status will be sent by the Associate Dean via our Slate Portal..How will I be notified of application status and decision?.Notification will be made via email..Please set email settings to allow all mail from mit.edu and whoi.edu and regularly check spam/trash folders..I’m on the waitlist, when will I find out if I am admitted?.Unfortunately, the timing of notifying waitlisted applicants is difficult to predict because it depends to some extent on when admitted applicants notify us of their decisions. We notify applicants on the waitlist as soon as possible if we are able to admit them. We do not generally send decline notices until we are certain that we will not be able to admit an applicant. We try to notify as many applicants as possible by April 15..Can I come and visit either MIT or WHOI?.Visits are not required for application or admission to the program. If you wish to schedule meetings with Joint Program faculty members, please.contact.them directly. You are encouraged to state your research interests, include your CV, unofficial transcript, dates of your availability, and any time constraints in your email.

If the subject has no MIT equivalent, approved transfer credit should be requested through a petition approved by the appropriate departmental graduate registration officer..The student's major department will determine to what extent subjects taken as a special student are acceptable for credit toward the requirements for an advanced degree. Credit received as a special graduate student is considered with all other academic information in reviewing the application and in formulating a degree program..Financial Aid.If I’m not accepted to the Joint Program with a fellowship, can I be accepted and pay for the tuition myself?.Unfortunately, that is not an option in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. Students admitted to the program are admitted with funding (i.e. they receive a stipend and tuition is paid for) and we do not have the option of having students pay their own tuition..What are the current stipend rates?.In 2023, the PhD stipend rate was $3,790 a month (before taxes), or approximately $45,480 per year.  New stipend rates are set and shared in April/May..Student Life.What is the average age of a Joint Program student?.The age of JP students ranges from 22 to 34 with the average being 26..Do most students have a master’s degree before they come to the Joint Program?.Many students come directly from undergraduate school.  We do have some that go on to get a master’s degree before enrolling in our program and others that have been in the work force for some time before returning to graduate school..How far is MIT from WHOI?.It is about an hour and 45 minute drive from WHOI to MIT. Please note, when classes are in session there is a free shuttle bus that transports students from MIT to WHOI and back twice a week along with daily public transportation options. Under some circumstances, students can also be reimbursed when using public transportation to commute between MIT and WHOI..For 2023 – 2024, you should be aware that the bridges that span the Cape Cod Canal, and so connect MIT and WHOI, are under construction.  Please expect some traffic, especially during rush hour travel..Does the program cover healthcare, including health insurance, dental and vision?.Under Massachusetts law, all students are required to be covered by comprehensive medical insurance..Access to MIT Medical is included with tuition payment – all Joint Program students are covered by the.Student Medical Plan.(SMP) however, extended insurance is required to cover services such as hospitalization. Note, this plan does not include dental coverage. Eye exams at MIT medical are included..Is housing guaranteed for all five years?.Unfortunately, housing is not guaranteed for all five years..It is typical during the first year or two in the Joint Program for students to take courses at MIT.  During this time, students are expected to live in the Cambridge area.  These students, upon showing proof of rent obligation (copy of Cambridge area lease), are eligible for free transient housing (an assigned bed for the duration of an academic term) or on-call housing (a bed assigned for brief, occasional visits) at WHOI.  Students who are not paying rent elsewhere must pay for WHOI transient housing at current rates..When students are no longer taking classes full time, they are expected to reside where their advisor/lab is located and to obtain housing in the local community.  Students based at MIT may use free on-call housing at WHOI, and students based at WHOI may use the MIT apartment for JP students for short stays (one or two nights) at no cost..The JP housing policy can be found here:.https://mit.whoi.edu/academics/policies/housing/.Are summer start dates flexible?.Yes, summer start dates are flexible and to be determined with the Academic Programs office and your advisor.

The institute has a well-organized placement team headed by the Associate Director, three Assistant Directors, and faculty and student coordinators from each department. The student body comprising Placement Secretaries from the Student Council and other support teams, provides seamless support to the students in the placement process..300+ recruiting teams, including 50+ Fortune 500 companies, visit MIT Manipal for UG and PG campus placements and internships recruitment every year..Some of the highlights of the Office of Industry Liaison, Placement, and Practice School include:.1..Career Counselling Cell.: MIT has a fully functional career counselling cell where students can approach for advice regarding their future career opportunities and higher education. Professors from various departments guide these students in their respective areas. This cell helps students make informed career choices concerning higher education. Besides counselling support, the Career Counselling Cell organises programs to create awareness of higher education opportunities in India and abroad..2..Placement Team:.MIT has a full-fledged student body.called the “Placement Team”, with Placement Secretaries of the student council at its helm. This body is involved in various placements-related activities that include conducting skill development programs, workshops related to placements, and social media connect, to name a few. This body strengthens the connection between the students, the recruiters, and the placement cell..3..Placement Portal.: The placement process at MIT is enabled through an automated Placement Portal, which allows students to apply for jobs with just a click of a button. The students are notified as and when a job is posted, and they can apply immediately through their mobile for the jobs. Through this portal, we provide students practice for various company-specific online tests, thus increasing the number of students clearing the tests..4..Coaching for CAT/GRE.: We have signed an MoU with one of the leading coaching institutes in India for training students for various entrance examinations to pursue their higher education in India and abroad. Interested students can make use of this opportunity. The classes are being held at MIT premises, so the students need not travel outside the campus for the training program..About Us.About Us.Leadership.Administration.Rankings.Accreditations & Affiliations.MIT Experience.Undergraduate Courses.Undergraduate Courses.BTech.Post Graduate Courses.Post Graduate Courses.MSc Chemistry.MCA.MTech.Important Links.Important Links.Program List.Admissions.Placements.Department and Faculty list.Scholarships.FAQ’s.Apply for admissions.Opens in New Tab.Download prospectus.Opens in New Tab.Newsletter Signup.SUBSCRIBE.We use cookies on this website to make your browsing experience better.

The technology’s label—magnetomicrometry—sounds unwieldy, but the solution itself is downright feathery. It’s based on small magnetic implants that measure muscle activity in the residual limb and can transmit the corresponding intent to the prosthesis..That job is routinely performed by myoelectric sensors in present devices, but the magnets can read muscle movements with far greater precision. When a muscle contracts, the beads get closer together; when it relaxes, they slide further apart. An external sensing device continuously monitors these signals and translates them into action, creating an intuitive interface that closely mimics natural limb movement..“I am very excited for the clinical potential of this new technology to improve the control and efficacy of bionic limbs for persons with limb loss,”.Herr told.MIT News...Although the system hasn’t been tested in humans yet, it has been validated in animal-based trials. In addition to providing reliably accurate measurements of muscle length and velocity, the magnetic implants didn’t cause scarring, inflammation, or other tissue damage..The research team, which also includes scholars from Harvard Medical School and Brown University, plans to test the system in humans as soon as the FDA grants approval. In addition to evaluating micromagnetometry’s potential for neuroprosthetic control, these tests may also yield data about the technology’s effects on proprioception, robotic limbs, and exoskeletons..Tags:.bionic hand.bionic leg.Bionics.Hugh Herr.MIT Media Lab.prosthetics.Previous Post.Research: Many Doctors Have an Anti-Disability Bias.Next Post.Caregiver Stress Increases Odds of Limb Loss.Next Post.Does Osseointegration Improve Amputees' Balance?.Subscribe Today.Recent Posts.Senator Duckworth to Feds: Enforce the ADA!.Young Amputee Cooking Star Serves Up Food for Thought.Altius PNS System Promises Pain Relief for Amputees.Top Inline Skating Tips for Below-Knee Amputees.Prototype Smart Socket Shows Promise for Amputees’ Comfort.201 East 4th Street.Loveland, CO 80537.303-255-0843.©2023 Amplitude Media Group.Today’s amputees are living more dynamic lives than ever before..Amplitude.tells their stories..About Us.Privacy Policy.Subscribe.FOLLOW US.Facebook.Twitter.Instagram.Linkedin.No part of this electronic publication/website may be reproduced in any form or by any means without prior written permission from Amplitude Media Group..No Result.View All Result.MAGAZINE.Subscribe.Current Issue.Archives.Living With Amplitude.Adaptive Living.Amputee to Amputee.Arts & Culture.Education.Featured.Getting Support.Giving Support.Health & Medicine.Money Matters.Relationships.Science & Technology.Sports & Recreation.Transportation & Mobility.More Amplitude.View Print Edition.NEWSLETTER.RESOURCES.Guide to Living With Limb Loss.Amputee Resource Directory.ABOUT US.Contact Us.Advertiser Information.Privacy Policy.Cookie Policy.Cancellation Policy.SUBSCRIBE.Subscribe to Magazine.Subscribe to Weekly Newsletter.Subscriptions FAQ.2024 PARALYMPICS.Latest News.Pathways to Paris.Meet the Athletes.Amplitude.We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

interests of the physical oceanography faculty and students. However, they are not exclusive. Students are encouraged to formulate their own programs according to their interests. Following each description is a list of the MIT and WHOI faculty involved with that area of study..Air-sea interaction.Air-sea interaction focuses on the exchange of mass, energy, and momentum across the air-water interface. The ocean circulation is largely driven by these exchanges so clear dynamical understanding of relevant governing processes and accurate characterization of the fluxes under a variety of conditions is crucial..Processes of interest include surface wave dynamics, mixed layer physics, Langmuir circulation, upper ocean turbulence, oceanic evaporation and precipitation, atmosphere and ocean coupled boundary layers..Faculty:.Carol Anne Clayson.,.Tom Farrar.,.Alex Gonzalez.,.Albert Plueddemann.,.Robert Weller.Bio-geo-chemical-physical interactions.The oceanic transport and fate of many natural and anthropological chemicals, such as carbon dioxide, are tightly coupled to the circulation. The establishment and viability of ecological communities, such as those near hydrothermal vents, is also dependent on the oceanic dynamics..Current research in these areas includes modeling of global bio-geo-chemical cycles, larvae transport in waves and fronts, and interactions of phytoplankton in turbulent flows..Faculty:.Ke Chen.,.Glenn Flierl.,.Mick Follows,.Glen Gawarkiewicz.,.Jake Gebbie.,.Amala Mahadevan.,.Dennis McGillicuddy.,.Irina Rypina.Coastal oceanography.Coastal oceanography concerns the dynamics of flow over the continental slope and shelf up to the beach and the coupling of these flows to the open ocean..Some current research topics include exchanges of heat, salt and other material between the open ocean and the shelf, wind and buoyancy-driven flows in shallow water, frontal dynamics over variable topography, estuary dynamics and buoyant outflows onto the shelf, and convection in shallow seas..Faculty:.Claudia Cenedese.,.Ke Chen.,.Nick Foukal,.Anthony Kirincich.,.Glen Gawarkiewicz.,.Christopher Piecuch.,.Robert Todd.Geophysical fluid dynamics.This is the study of fluid dynamics applied to geophysical systems. It provides the theoretical foundation for much of physical oceanography..The problems studied are typically idealized and chosen to illustrate and provide insight into the basic features of oceanic and atmospheric flows. What types of flow do the equations of motion allow? Problems of current interest include large-scale circulation dynamics, stability of flows, turbulence, chaotic motions and transport, nonlinear waves, and vortices..Faculty:.Claudia Cenedese.,.Rafaelle Ferrari,.Glenn Flierl.,.Alex Gonzalez.,.John Marshall.,.Lawrence Pratt.,.Michael Spall.High latitude/polar oceanography.High-latitude regions play a crucial role in ocean circulation. It is in these regions that the densest waters are produced, which then sink to great depths and fill the abyssal oceans. The interaction of the high latitudes with the subpolar regions is crucial for many climate issues..Current research areas include dynamics of deep convection, ice dynamics, and air-sea interactions in extreme conditions..Faculty:.Magdalena Andres.,.Claudia Cenedese.,.Sylvia Cole,.Nick Foukal.,.Glen Gawarkiewicz.,.Isabela Le Bras.,.John Marshall.,.Robert Pickart.,.Andrey Proshutinsky.,.Michael Spall.,.John Toole.Large-scale dynamics.Describing and understanding the dynamics of large-scale oceanic gyres, western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream, and global water property distributions have been a central goal of physical oceanography since the inception of the discipline. This spans the upper wind-driven ocean to the deep abyssal circulation, from the equator to the poles..Examples of research topics are dynamics of the Antarctic circumpolar current, float observations of global mid-depth circulation, modeling of basin scale, and global circulation modeling constrained by observations..Faculty:.Magdalena Andres.,.Amy Bower.,.Glenn Flierl.,.Nick Fouka.l,.Jake Gebbie.,.Steve Jayne.,.Young-Oh Kwon.,.Isabela Le Bras.,.John Marshall.,.Robert Pickart.,.Christopher Piecuch.,.Andrey Proshutinsky.,.Michael Spall.,.John Toole.,.Susan Wijffels.,.Jiayan Yang.,.Lisan Yu.Mesoscale processes.Mesoscale refers to motions smaller than the oceanic gyres, yet large enough to be affected by the earth's rotation. These include intense frontal currents, eddies such as Gulf Stream Rings, geostrophic turbulence, flow through straits and over sills..Faculty:.Magdalena Andres.,.Amy Bower.,.Claudia Cenedese.,.Ke Chen.,.Sylvia Cole,.Rafaelle Ferrari.,.Glenn Flierl.,.John Marshall.,.Kurt Polzin,.Lawrence Pratt.,.Michael Spall.,.Robert Todd.Mixing and small-scale processes.The rates at which the ocean is able to sequester heat and carbon dioxide are crucially dependent on the small-scale processes that actually mix fluid properties at the molecular level. These processes include turbulence induced by breaking internal waves and double-diffusive phenomena such as salt fingers. The global energetics of mixing derived from the tides and the wind are related to the strength of the thermohaline overturning, so mixing processes are readily related to the large-scale circulation..Faculty:.Claudia Cenedese,.Carol Anne Clayson.,.Sylvia Cole,.Tom Farrar.,.Rafaelle Ferrari.,.Steve Jayne.,.Kurt Polzin.,.John Toole.Oceans, atmosphere, and climate; paleoclimate.The oceans play a central role in climate. They transport a substantial fraction of the heat from the equatorial zone to the poles, sequester carbon, transport freshwater as part of the global hydrological cycle, act as a regulator to global climate shifts, and yet may also precipitate rapid changes in climate..Examples of current research on climate includes modeling of the coupled global air-land-ocean system, time-series observations of ocean state, modeling of ocean circulation under ancient continental configurations, and dynamics of thermohaline circulation..Faculty:.Ke Chen.,.Carol Anne Clayson.,.Nick Fouka.l,.Jake Gebbie.,.Alex Gonzalez,.Young-Oh Kwon.,.John Marshall.,.Christopher Piecuch.,.Andrey Proshutinsky.,.Hyodae Seo.,.Caroline Ummenhofer.,.Jiayan Yang.,.Lisan Yu.MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

You'll get to work with cylinders, valves, sensors, robotic arm and a lot of other things..The subjects are interesting and tough. Scoring marks isn't a very easy job, but you would enjoy understanding the concepts and then applying them into automation and robotics..The faculty is okay. Some of them are extremely good and interested in teaching, but some are just irritated souls who come and takeout their frustration in college. The HOD belongs to the latter category, sadly!.Nevertheless, all the faculty members are very helpful!.The placements aren't very good, but considering it's still a growing branch in India, the future is bright in the industry.So, in conclusion, mechatronics in MIT, Manipal is a brilliant choice and you should go ahead with it unless you're getting some core branch here, then you should still weigh your options once.I hope this helped you!.PS- I am in 4th year mechatronics engineering in MIT..Upvote.·.99.53.9.9.Anonymous.Upvoted by.Vivek Bhat.,.studied at Manipal Institute Of Technology (2022).and.Aseem Shrivastava.,.B.Tech Mechatronics, Manipal Institute Of Technology (2015).·.10y.Related.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.MIT, Manipal is one of the few colleges that provide an education in Mechatronics Engineering.

The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago..As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:.1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects. They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal. Hope it helps..Upvote.·.999.103.99.11.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month.

In a couple of sentences, show that you have spent some time learning about their research interests. In some cases, you might only have learned a little bit from their website and be interested in learning more (that’s ok). In other cases, you might be more familiar with their work (e.g., have read some papers or have seen them give a presentation) and have a very specific interest in their lab..Make a clear request..Do you want to know if they are looking to advise a student next year? Do you have questions about their future research? Would you like to meet with them? If you are asking for a meeting, suggest some things that you would like to talk about..Provide additional information.. Attaching short CV and/or unofficial transcript is often useful. In a sentence or two, you might also suggest some skills and experiences that you would bring to their program..Show respect for their time..Faculty members often get many requests. You might suggest a 30-minute meeting and offer to arrange the logistics (make the phone call or send a meeting link). Be prepared with specific questions..Ask to speak with other lab members..Talking with current or former students, postdocs or staff members is an excellent way to get a more holistic view of what it would be like to be a member of the lab group..Put your best foot forward!.Proofread your email before sending. A second pair of eyes can help – consider asking a friend or mentor read your email and the materials you plan to send..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

the seafloor.The interactions between geological and biological systems.The history of ocean circulation patterns and climate change preserved in seafloor and lake sediments, corals, ice sheets, and other natural archives.Climate variability and impacts.Approach to the challenge.Marine geologists approach these problems through studies of oceanic rocks, sediments. Marine geophysicists are primarily concerned with the application of gravity, magnetics, heat flow, and seismic methods to study the structure of the earth beneath the oceans. Climate scientists develop and use a variety of techniques to reconstruct past oceans and climates, with the goal of providing perspective for ongoing and future climate change. Within the Joint Program, there are geologists, geochemists, geophysicists, and climate scientists who conduct research on a wide variety of topics, including:.Dynamics of convection in the mantle that drives the motion of tectonic plates.Tectonic, volcanic, and hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges, and the structure of the oceanic crust.Coastal processes and the structure of continental margins.Interactions of continental and oceanic geologic processes.Past, present and future climate variability and impacts.Interdisciplinary work.Investigators from different disciplines also often work together with the goal of understanding the interactions between earth's processes, the oceans, and ecosystems. Geological processes influence the chemistry of the oceans and impact the distribution of organisms. Similarly, biological processes affect the chemistry of the oceans and sediments, and can even alter the composition of oceanic crust. Climate studies are naturally interdisciplinary..Research tools and techniques.To explore the seafloor, marine geologists and geophysicists use a wide range of research tools and techniques, including field work, laboratory analyses, and numerical modeling. Many go to sea on research vessels to collect data and samples, either remotely using geophysical tools, rock dredging, sediment coring, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or directly using a submersible. While climate scientists also often use seafloor samples, they also use other natural archives such as lake and marsh sediment, corals, ice sheets, cave deposits, and trees to develop climate reconstructions.  Across these subdisciplines, cruises and field work are typically followed by extensive data and/or sample analysis in the laboratory, and interpretation and modeling of the results..Unique opportunity.In the Joint Program, graduate students have a unique opportunity for training and research in fields including geophysics, petrology and geochemistry, coastal processes, past, present, and future climate variability and impacts..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

The balance of the support costs may be provided by the Academic Programs Office at WHOI, appropriate MIT Institute funds, or through an advisor's research program.  As a student, you are responsible for meeting a fellowship's requirements for eligibility, area of research, and progress reporting. Most outside fellowships are intended to support students while doing both course work and thesis research and do not involve other obligations..Related Links.».American Association of University Women (AAUW) Fellowships.».American Meteorolgical Society (AMS) Graduate Fellowships.».Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF).».Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program.».Ford Foundation (for minorities).».Hertz Foundation Fellowship.».Massachusetts Sea Grant Graduate Research Fellowship.».National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Graduate Fellowships.».National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG).».National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).».U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) STAR Fellowship.Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA) on Grants and Contracts.This is the most common source of support for Joint Program students. It differs in some important aspects from the other sources of funding. Advisors may have GRA support before accepting a student or may secure it after the student has entered the program. In some cases, the student may write all or part of a grant proposal for his or her support, with the advisor as the principal investigator..Students supported as GRAs are expected to work half-time on their grant projects, whether or not a project is related to a student's thesis research. Advisors are responsible for trying to obtain continuing grant support for their students who are on GRAs or will need support when other sources of funding are completed. Usually, GRA funding can be planned so that the grant work contributes, at least indirectly, to the student's progress..Students and advisors need to discuss this issue in advance of beginning GRA support, so that obligations and expectations are understood and accepted..Obligations may include a variety of research and scholarly activities as well as activities in support of research such as field and laboratory work, literature searches and reviews, data synthesis, theoretical computations, and database management..MIT and WHOI cost share 65% of the academic semester's tuition and all of the summer semester tuition for GRA support on grants and contracts. The exact mechanisms of cost sharing and the overhead and benefits costs applied to a GRA are different for each institution as part of the U.S. government-approved accounting rules governing each institution..WHOI-Administered or MIT-Administered Traineeships.These are generally derived from a grant to the respective institution, and are given to incoming or resident students based on criteria of the granting agency and/or the institution. Such traineeships may be used to support research in specific disciplines or subdisciplines (e.g., Coastal Research Traineeships); but, like outside fellowships, they generally do not require you to spend significant time on work other than your courses and research..MIT Teaching Assistantships/WHOI Teaching Fellowships.Although teaching assistantships are a common source of graduate student support in most universities, including MIT, there are only a few available at MIT for Joint Program students, especially those in residence in Woods Hole. The WHOI Academic Programs Office has limited funds to support a few students per semester as Paul M. Fye Teaching Fellows. These students are expected to work half-time (20 hours per week) or one-quarter time (10 hours per week) as teaching assistants or teaching fellows, under the supervision of the course instructor(s)..Specific duties vary depending on the size and nature of the course. You should undertake a teaching assistantship/teaching fellowship only after consultation with your advisor to ensure that the time commitment will not adversely affect progress toward your degree..Teaching assistantships at MIT are assigned by MIT departments upon recommendation by course instructors. Teaching fellowship availability and awards at WHOI are requested by the course instructor(s) through the J. Seward Johnson Chair/Education Coordinator in each WHOI department and approved by the WHOI Dean upon the recommendation of the WHOI Associate Dean, who takes into account all teaching fellowship needs for the semester..MIT Fellowships.A limited number of fellowships are available from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program office at MIT and are awarded by the Director of the Joint Program at MIT to mainly first- and second-year students..Additionally, there are some fellowships managed by MIT-only.  (see below Related Link for more information).Related Links.».External MIT Fellowships for current Joint Program students.WHOI Fellowships.The Academic Programs Office has several fellowships for first- and second-year students that have been endowed in honor of individuals. In addition, funds are available to supplement outside fellowships. The Academic Programs Office also coordinates other WHOI-based fellowships such as those from the Institutes at WHOI or from other special funds designated for graduate student fellowship support. In addition, the WHOI Academic Programs Office, through its endowment income and occasional gifts designated for student support, administers funds that can be used for graduate fellowship support, but only after all other support sources have been exhausted..The most common use of these funds is for students whose GRA funding has ended prior to completion of their thesis or when there is a short funding hiatus between grants or contracts. Student responsibilities to the advisor are the same as those expected with other funding sources..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

Interactions in Western Boundary Current Jets.Spatial and Temporal Variability of Tide-Induced Salt Flux in a Partially Mixed Estuary.Physical Oceanography (PO).PO Research at WHOI.Physical oceanography is the exploration and study of the physics and geography of the ocean currents and water properties. These complex oceanic motions occur over a wide variety of space and time scales including:.Grand persistent currents, like the Gulf Stream and the wind-driven ocean gyres.Transient eddies and waves of all sizes and speeds from surface gravity waves, to slower internal waves beneath the sea surface, to planetary-scale Rossby waves.Estuary and rivers outflows onto the continental shelf.Coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, both local and global.Physical oceanography has important applications in global climate and coastal studies. It is also a key element in interdisciplinary studies of primary production, hydrothermal vents, and oceanic flux and storage of carbon dioxide..Air and water.There are similarities in how the atmosphere and the ocean move and, as such, physical oceanography has much in common with meteorology. As in the atmosphere, relatively intense frontal systems exist in the oceans. Mixing and stirring occurs across these oceanic fronts, caused by a variety of physical processes ranging....From instabilities of large-scale currents such as the Gulf Stream that generate long-lived "rings," much as atmospheric storm systems are spawned from the Jet Stream.To salt fingers, no bigger than a centimeter, which produce efficient vertical exchanges of salt and heat between different water masses.Understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean is also a key challenge for physical oceanographers. The ocean and atmosphere drive each other in as yet poorly understood ways, with a multitude of consequences..From lab to field.Physical oceanographers employ a wide variety of scientific skills and approaches, from the most descriptive to the most theoretical, to explain oceanic motions. Want to be both a theorist.and.an experimentalist? This field is one of the few areas of physics in which you can achieve that goal. In fact, students in the Joint Program have the opportunity, and indeed are encouraged, to develop skills and experience in both approaches..Observational work.To measure such oceanic properties as temperature, salinity, pressure, and velocity, observational oceanographers use a variety of sophisticated instruments, which may be shipborne, drifting, moored, on autonomous submersibles, or mounted on aircraft or satellites..Research cruises collect water property and flow data in both nearby and remote regions of the globe. Submerged neutrally buoyant floats are tracked for hundreds of kilometers in studies of ocean currents. Instrumented moorings record currents, temperature, and salinity throughout the water column. These and other data provide the essential descriptive foundation for a conceptual understanding of the causes of oceanic motions..But observational oceanography is much more than cataloging oceanic features. Modern observational work is designed as much to test theoretical hypotheses as it is to provide new data in unknown regions. Observational studies are sometimes limited to specific processes, such as deep overflows or air-sea interaction, and sometimes global in extent, such as efforts to map the distribution of eddy kinetic energy derived from satellite observations. Some observational programs are limited in duration but involve extensive spatial measurements; others are designed to give long-term time series of oceanic conditions at one specific location..In almost all cases, observational work is done with the most modern of instruments and data analysis procedures to extract information from a dynamic and challenging environment..Theoretical work.Theoreticians and modelers attempt to explain the observed flow and the structure of temperature and salinity distributions in the ocean. Another role of theory and numerical modeling is to uncover new dynamical concepts and processes that may not have been apparent, or were overlooked, in existing observations..This work can involve the construction of the simplest mathemetical models as a means of illuminating some new, unexpected process. Or it can involve the analysis of sophisticated mathematical models with modern mathematical methods of considerable complexity..Theory can be supplemented and extended by numerical modeling of dynamical processes that are just too complex to be treated with analytical methods. A good example is turbulent flows, both small-scale mixing and large-scale geostrophic turbulence. These numerical studies may produce solutions to specially derived sets of equations, or they may involve numerical models of the general equations governing fluid flow appropriate to oceanic conditions. This modeling ranges from models specific processes, such as western boundary currents, to global-scale simulations of oceanic flow..Laboratory experimentation also plays a crucial role in the development and testing of basic theoretical ideas. Laboratory experiments can be used to explore new dynamical regions for which no theory exists, or to provide controlled, repeatable data (rarely obtainable from the ocean) to throughly test the predictions of a theory or numerical calculation..Putting theory and observations together.Neither observations or theory alone are enough to solve the mysteries of oceanic circulation. Physical oceanography is mature enough to have a substantial body of theory to aid in the interpretation of observations, yet the ocean is continually offering new data to challenge existing ideas of how the ocean works. The deepest understanding and most interesting results almost always evolve from the interplay between these two approaches. This interaction is what makes physical oceanography such an exciting subject and leaves plenty of opportunity for someone entering the field..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

The core curriculum is designed to accommodate this diversity of backgrounds, and provides a thorough yet accessible introduction to the field..Is PPSM its own department?.No. PPSM is an interdepartmental program, so each PPSM student has a.home department.(the participating department that admitted the student to graduate study at MIT). While all five of the participating departments accept the PPSM graduate core curriculum and doctoral quals in place of the equivalent departmental offerings, each department has a graduate office that sets rules and guidelines for its graduate students, including those who are participating in PPSM. These guidelines include thesis committee composition and frequency of meetings, minor subject requirements, arrangements for co-advising, teaching assistant responsibilities and others.  PPSM students are expected to fulfill the requirements of the home department in every case.  PPSM students end up being well-versed in both their traditional disciplinary field and in polymer science; this is a significant asset in the current interdisciplinary research and development environment..What are the Testing Requirements for PPSM (GRE, IELTS, etc.)?.Testing Requirements are.strictly part of the.departmental application process.. PPSM only considers candidates who have already successfully gained an offer of admission from one of our five affiliate departments, and therefore does not establish its own requirements for test score submissions or minimum acceptable scores..Visit MIT Graduate Admissions Testing Requirements webpage to download PDF showing each MIT department’s Testing Requirements..Can I apply to PPSM through more than one PPSM-Affiliated MIT Department?.Yes, however you may be charged an additional application fee for each department you apply to..Do I send my PPSM Letter of Notification before or after I receive a decision letter from the department to which I’ve applied?.Please send your PPSM Letter of Notification immediately after submitting your online application to your chosen PPSM Affiliated department(s). During the review process, the Letter of Notification enables PPSM to optimize admissions information sharing with PPSM’s five affiliated departments..Which MIT faculty member can serve as my thesis research advisor?.If agreeable to the home department, any MIT faculty member can serve as a thesis advisor regardless of their affiliation with PPSM. The web pages.PPSM Faculty and Faculty Affiliates.provide listings of MIT faculty that are actively involved in PPSM and/or polymer research. Co-advising of students across departmental boundaries is encouraged and is common practice for PPSM research. Updates on the availability of research support and on the latest thesis topics being offered are obtained by direct contact with the faculty..Are PPSM students required to have a PPSM Faculty member on their Thesis Committees?.No–PPSM does not have a fixed policy on the composition of thesis committees. Instead, PPSM students are expected to follow the guidelines of their home departments. Please contact the Academic Administrator for your department with questions about Thesis Committee procedures and regulations..If you have a question about PPSM that is not answered above, please contact us with your question via our.Ask PPSM.page..Accessibility.Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.Powered by.WordPress.and Mystique theme by.digitalnature.|.RSS Feeds.Go to Top

(Mechatronics engineering or mechanical engineering).Mechanical engineering is better. If you want to work for a robotics company, you should have a particular skillset that you are specialized in. Mechanical engineering (as well as electrical engineering and computer science) offers you that skillset. Mechatronics engineering does not. Mechatronics engineering teaches skills from all 3 areas that I mentioned earlier—mechanical, electrical, and CS. It makes you a generalist, not a specialist. You will be ok at many skills, but you will be a master of none..Compare that to mechanical engineering, which will make you an expert at structural design,.Continue Reading.Mechanical engineering is better.

Mechatronics engineering teaches skills from all 3 areas that I mentioned earlier—mechanical, electrical, and CS. It makes you a generalist, not a specialist. You will be ok at many skills, but you will be a master of none..Compare that to mechanical engineering, which will make you an expert at structural design, which you can then use to design a robot’s frame. Sure, you might not learn how to program or do circuits (although I think most MechE degrees do cover that content briefly nowadays), but that doesn’t matter. That’s for the programmer and the electrical engineer to work on. If a company wants to build a robot, do you think they would rather hire 3 people who are experts in their respective fields, or 3 people who are ok at all fields? I think you get the idea here..I have been asked this same question numerous times, and I stand by my belief that you should go for a traditional engineering degree as opposed to majoring in the hybrid mess that is Mechatronics engineering. Don’t focus on the big picture, focus on what YOU are going to contribute. On a day-to-day basis, you are not going to be working on every single part of a robot by yourself, you will be focused on making your part work, and that’s it. So my recommendation is to do mechanical engineering..Upvote.·.9.3.Mohamed Khaled.Studied at.Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University.·.6y.Related.What should I choose, a mechatronic or a computer engineering?.Both are great and it depends on your preferences, both fields have great future.

Advances in motor drive strategy have allowed engineers to achieve unprecedented gains in the dynamic response, steady accuracy, and parameter robustness in power electronic converters. Although these methods have proven to be very successful, there are a few well-known shortcomings of these methods:.1) The quality of calibrations of PI regulator parameters and MTPA (Maximum Torque Per Ampere)map heavily depends on the experience of the operator;.2) The accuracy of parameters of IPMSM deeply affect the robustness of control system;.3) Dynamic response speed and steady accuracy of the control system are not satisfied in certain applications for instance, the active damping of torque ripples for a hybrid power system..To address these challenges, machine learning-based control theory is recognized as one promising solution to enabling devices that can operate at self-learning and less calibration resulting in smarter and more efficient performance. This project aims to study the intelligent IPMSM control technologies by leveraging recent advances in online and/or reinforcement machine learning methods to achieve an adaptive, robust and intelligent control strategy..The control framework proposed for this project, as depicted above, consists of three levels. The baseline controllers are responsible for dealing with internal model uncertainties and external disturbances. On top of that, learning and prediction level control aims to further optimize the performance indexes of the plant. While decision-making and planning level takes multimode sensor signals as input and generates proper commands to modules operated in parallel. Our aim is to develop a computationally and experimentally validated intelligent embedded MCUprototype. The proposed control approach and system has the potential to be applied for various motor control scenarios in a wide range of industrial areas such as the emerging electric vehicle industry.Publications.No publications for now..© 2020 MIT Mechatronics Research Lab.Youtube Channel.Director.Accessibility.Search for:.Recent Posts.Hydrogel.3D Deprinter: A Robot for Cellphone Disassembly, Repair and Recyle.Leak Detection System For City Water Distribution Systems.AFM team won 2014 National Instruments Engineering Impact Awards.Leak Detection.Archives.Archives.Select Month.June 2018.September 2017.March 2017.September 2014.July 2014.March 2014.January 2014.November 2013.August 2013.Categories.Control.Power.Projects.Publications.Robot.Uncategorized.Meta.Log in.Entries feed.Comments feed.WordPress.org.© 2024 Mechatronics Research Laboratory

MIT-WHOI Joint Program is for each student to achieve his or her full intellectual potential in the chosen area of study and research, either within the more traditional disciplines of ocean sciences and engineering or within interdisciplinary studies incorporating two or more disciplines..To guide students in this endeavor the MIT-WHOI Joint Program faculty has established five focal areas: biological oceanography, chemical oceanography, marine geology and geophysics, physical oceanography and applied ocean physics and engineering. The Joint Committee associated with each focal area provides guidance as to the course of study for incoming students who have strong interests in that focal area..Many applicants have interests, academic background, and experience that are appropriate for one of these focal areas and they will be admitted to pursue their degree in that area. It is also likely that some incoming students will have, or develop, interests that span two or more of these focal areas. These students will be admitted to the focal area that is most appropriate for their preparation and stated interests. This ensures that the student has a well defined 'home' within the Joint Program..During the first semester in the Joint Program, as early as practical, each student should assemble and meet with an academic advisory committee to discuss their research interests and formulate a tentative individual course of study. The structure of the advisory committee will be defined by the student's primary Joint Committee, but typically the advisory committee will consist of at least the student's primary research advisor (who may or may not be from the 'home' focal area) and a faculty member from the other institution..For those students whose research interests significantly overlap two or more Joint Committee focal areas this advisory committee should, at the request of the student and the principal advisor, include faculty from the related focal area(s) at one or both institutions. The individual course of study will lead to a general examination with a format and scope that are both generally consistent with the requirements of the primary focal area's Joint Committee and flexible enough to recognize the individualized aspects of the course of study. The course of study must be approved by the primary Joint Committee, preferably by the end of the first year. The format of the exam also must be determined by the primary Joint Committee, and will be set no later than early in the semester before the exam. It is expected that the advisory committee will guide the student up to and through the general exam, after which the oversight will move to the student's Ph.D. thesis committee, whose membership must be approved by the home Joint Committee. The home Joint Committee will be responsible for monitoring the student's academic progress through the thesis defense..Version 8. revised (5/14/04).Examples of Interdisciplinary Academic Studies.Physical Oceanography.Physical-biological interactions track.These are the courses taken by two a Ph.D. graduates who focused on mechanisms of physical-biological interaction in the open ocean.  These programs of study included extensive coursework in both physical and biological oceanography, as well an introductory course in marine chemistry.  One student supplemented the Joint Program offerings with extra-curricular summer courses in microbial ecology and ecosystems/climate..Ph.D. Graduate Example 1:.Courses completed for master's degree:.12.800 - Fluid Dynamics of Atmosphere & Ocean.12.818 - Atmospheric Data & Synoptic Meteorology.18.075 - Advanced Calculus for Engineers.Term.Course Number.Course Name.Fall.12.742.Marine Chemistry.12.808.Intro to Observational Physical Oceanography.12.862.Coastal Physical Oceanography.18.085.Computational Science & Engineering I.Spring.7.440.Introduction to Mathematical Ecology.7.47.Biological Oceanography.12.802.Wave Motions in the Ocean and Atmosphere.12.823.Modeling the Biology and Physics of the Ocean.Summer.C-MORE Agouron course on Microbial Oceanography.NCAR ASP Colloquium on Ecosystems and Climate.Fall.2.29.Numerical Fluid Mechanics.12.803.Quasi-Balanced Circulations.12.804.Large-scale Flow Dynamics Lab.Spring.7.437.Topics:Molec Biol Oceanography.12.801.General Circulation of Ocean.12.820.Turbulence in Ocean and Atmos.Spring 3rd year.7.410.Applied Statistics.Ph.D. Graduate Example 2:.Term.Course Number.Course Name.Fall.12.800.Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean.12.808.Introduction to Observational Physical Oceanography.12.842.Climate Physics and Chemistry.12.491.Topics in Geophysics: Biogeochemistry of Sulfur.Spring.7.430.Linking Models to Observations of Plankton Ecosystems.12.801.Steady Circulation of the Ocean.12.802.Waves.18.075.Advanced Calculus for Engineers.Summer.C-MORE Agouron course on Microbial Oceanography.Fall.12.803.Quasi-Balanced Circulations.12.804.Large-Scale Flow Dynamics Lab.12.742.Marine Chemistry.Spring.7.440.Mathematical Ecology.12.823.Biological Physical Modelling.Fall.12.747.Modeling, Data Analysis and Numerical Techniques for Geochemistry.Applied Ocean Science and Engineering - Civil Engineering.Physical-biological interactions track.This is the course syllabus followed by a Ph.D. graduate who studied the ways in which the ocean's physical environment, especially the flow environment, affects the distribution of marine organisms.

My family never knew lavish luxury. My father faced several near-death experiences throughout my childhood, and my mother was often the only one providing for the family. We used to live on less than $12,000 a year, and in the Silicon Valley at that… you can deduce the rest..I’d always wanted to attend community college and provide for my parents just as they’d provided for me. I was content with hustling day-by-day in the long run. I didn’t even know Stanford was just a twenty-minute drive away until my sophomore year of high school—I’d assumed it was in Washington or something. I knew nothing about colleges..High school came, and with it the realization that I could do more, that the circumstances which defined my childhood were in no way shackles to my future. I worked hard. I made the right friends and stayed away from the wrong ones. I matured and got over myself. I did my research into where I’d grow most as a person. It all paid off..I distinctly remember my peers, from both my high school and other high schools around me, freaking out about how they were to get their college essays proofread, how they would present themselves in the best possible light to the admissions committees of their respective colleges..I, on the other hand, saw their concerns as irrelevant..Not a single soul saw my college essays. Not a single soul proofread them..I worked on them and proofread them myself, thinking about what the words meant to.me., not to someone I’d pass them to. Did I convey my story in as a raw a way as possible? Did I flesh myself out? Those were the questions that mattered to me. I also didn’t prepare for my MIT interview, not in the traditional sense with which a computer science student might prepare for a coding interview at Google, because I wanted to be.real.. I wanted to deliver my answers straight from the heart, not from some array prefilled with deterministic ouputs. In technical aspects, I did what most did—I did research, I was highly interested in math and biology, and I loved learning for the sake of learning..My interviewer ended up liking me a lot, and I believe my essays must have had some impact on my admissions officers, as I wouldn’t be here now if they didn’t..I wonder sometimes how different life would be now had I chosen to stay home and work. I can’t pay my parents back yet for all they’ve done, but I hope to do so in a few years. Family will always matter to me..In the end, one could argue that the college process is ultimately arbitrary. Who’s to say that there wasn’t someone who deserved the spot more than I? I can’t address that grey area, but I believe hard work, realism, and a commitment to oneself are all important factors. :).Upvote.·.999.188.9.4.Ruthvik Reddy.B.tech EEE from.Manipal Institute Of Technology (MIT).(Graduated 2024).·.3y.Originally Answered:.What can I get in MIT Manipal main campus in 16123 rank, is mechatronics possible?.·.Yes, u might get mechatronics in the main campus, but you have to wait until the fourth round of counselling..Upvote.·.Marilee Jones.experienced admissions officer, educator, urban shaman.·.Upvoted by.Nick Williams.,.B.S.

It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors..But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different..As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others..MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted..If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work..And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth..I hope this helps..Upvote.·.2.7K.2.7K.99.82.99.58.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you..Continue Reading.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better?

Basically the system as a whole..Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest. I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot. The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field. The Labs are world class. Research is a bit lagging. Practical exposure is excellent. But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc. which is gold if you love robotics..If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field. Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study.

There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers. The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields. Basically the system as a whole..Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest. I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot. The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field. The Labs are world class. Research is a bit lagging. Practical exposure is excellent. But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc. which is gold if you love robotics..If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field. Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study. However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India..I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics. There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics..Upvote.·.99.18.9.2.9.1.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill.

You'll get to work with cylinders, valves, sensors, robotic arm and a lot of other things..The subjects are interesting and tough. Scoring marks isn't a very easy job, but you would enjoy understanding the concepts and then applying them into automation and robotics..The faculty is okay. Some of them are extremely good and interested in teaching, but some are just irritated souls who come and takeout their frustration in college. The HOD belongs to the latter category, sadly!.Nevertheless, all the faculty members are very helpful!.The placements aren't very good, but considering it's still a growing branch in India, the future is bright in the industry.So, in conclusion, mechatronics in MIT, Manipal is a brilliant choice and you should go ahead with it unless you're getting some core branch here, then you should still weigh your options once.I hope this helped you!.PS- I am in 4th year mechatronics engineering in MIT..Upvote.·.99.53.9.9.Anonymous.Upvoted by.Vivek Bhat.,.studied at Manipal Institute Of Technology (2022).and.Aseem Shrivastava.,.B.Tech Mechatronics, Manipal Institute Of Technology (2015).·.10y.Related.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.MIT, Manipal is one of the few colleges that provide an education in Mechatronics Engineering.

The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago..As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:.1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects. They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal.

Under the Language Exams and Languages of Instruction sections, check the box next to the statement: I request to have the TOEFL/IELTS exam requirement waived because I meet the.requirements stated above..The following is the MIT Policy regarding English Language Proficiency which the MIT-WHOI Joint Program follows:.English is the language of instruction in all subjects within the Institute, and all papers and theses must be written in English.  All applicants whose first language is not English, including those currently enrolled in U.S. institutions, must present evidence of their ability to carry on their studies in English by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS). A minimum TOEFL score of 100 is required by the Institute; however, some departments require higher scores. Refer to department information for testing requirements. Scores below 100 may result in the withholding of the visa documentation for a candidate otherwise considered admissible..In addition to the TOEFL, all students whose first language is not English are required to take the English Evaluation Test (E.E.T.) at MIT during the week prior to Registration Day. This examination is a diagnostic test whose purpose is to help students identify their strengths and weaknesses in written and oral English. English classes may be recommended as a result of the E.E.T..Unlike IELTS or TOEFL, many countries offer the Cambridge English Qualification as part of an English language course in their school curriculum. For applicants in these countries, the exam’s registration fee is waived as part of their broader educational curriculum.Application Fee Waiver.Effective Fall 2015:.The Office of Graduate Education (OGE) at MIT is pleased to offer fee waivers for U.S. Citizens and U.S. Permanent Residents who demonstrate financial hardship, are current or former members of the U.S. Armed Forces, or who have participated in special fellowship programs, including MIT-sponsored diversity programs (e.g. MIT Summer Research Program, CONVERGE). The OGE Diversity Initiatives is also pleased to offer fee waivers to prospective students we have met during diversity recruitment events. International students, attending U.S. colleges and universities, who have participated in the MIT CONVERGE or MSRP programs are also eligible to apply for a fee waiver..Eligible applicants should submit the.fee waiver form..A very limited number of fee waivers are available to students who are not eligible for these programs. Preference will be given to economically disadvantaged international applicants who have identified a potential advisor. Interested applicants may submit inquiries to.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu..The application fee is good for a single academic year only; applications reactivated in future academic years will require new fees..MIT: Joint Program Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.617 253-7544.WHOI: Academic Programs Office.mit-whoi-www@mit.edu.508 289-2225.About:.Parent Institutions.Accreditation.Contact.MIT Diversity Statement.WHOI Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.Quick links:.Application.Statistics.Handbooks.Graphics.© 2022 MIT-WHOI Joint Program.

There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers. The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields. Basically the system as a whole..Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest. I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot. The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field. The Labs are world class. Research is a bit lagging. Practical exposure is excellent. But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc. which is gold if you love robotics..If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field. Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study. However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India..I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics. There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics..Upvote.·.99.18.9.2.9.1.Promoted by The Penny Hoarder.Lisa Dawson.Founder at The Penny Hoarder.·.Updated Jun 28.What are the worst things people overspend on in the U.S.?.You’ve done what you can to cut back your spending..You brew coffee at home, you don’t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast.

(Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?).But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you’re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we’re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries….So if you’re ready to stop paying them, follow these moves….1. Overpriced Insurance: Cancel Your Car Insurance.You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix..Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called.Insurify.shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year..If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you..Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and.see how much you could save on car insurance..2. Online Shopping: If You Don’t Use This Free Tool, You’re Overpaying on Amazon.Wouldn’t it be nice if you got an alert when you’re shopping online at Amazon and are about to overpay?.That’s exactly what.this free service.does..Just add it to your browser for free, and before you check out, it’ll check other websites to see if your item is available for cheaper. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new smart vacuum, and you assume you’ve found the best price. Here’s when you’ll get a pop up letting you know if that exact vacuum is available elsewhere for cheaper. If there are any available coupon codes, they’ll also automatically be applied to your order..In the last year, this has saved people $800 million..You can get started in just a few clicks to.see if you’re overpaying online...3. Internet: Get One Month of Free High-Speed Internet (and Pay as Little as $40/Month After That).There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. Your provider knows it’s pretty hard to go without it these days — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.Metro by T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as *$40 a month. No credit check, no deposit, and they won’t lock you into a contract that hikes up your price after your first year, either..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 14 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, get one month free after the rebate and purchase your equipment for just $24.99 (usually $49.99)..Switch to Metro by T-Mobile and get 5G Home Internet from Metro for $40/mo with AutoPay. Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify..4. Interest: Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company.If you have credit card debt,.you know.. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape….And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called.AmOne.wants to help..If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances..The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt.that.much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month..You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau..It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to.see what loans you qualify for.— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls..5. Wasting Time: Get Paid $225/Month While Watching Movie Previews.If we told you that you could get paid while watching videos on your computer, you’d probably laugh..It’s too good to be true, right?.But we’re serious. By signing up for a free account with.InboxDollars., you could add up to $225 a month to your pocket. They’ll send you short surveys every day, which you can fill out while you watch someone bake brownies or catch up on the latest Kardashian drama..No, InboxDollars won’t replace your full-time job, but it’s something easy you can do while you’re already on the couch tonight, wasting time on your phone..Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash — no points or gift cards. It’s already paid its users more than $56 million..Signing up takes about one minute, and you’ll immediately receive.a $5 bonus.to get you started..6. Add $500 to Your Wallet for Trying Out Apps.Our smartphones are the world’s greatest time-killers. You can browse Facebook; play a game; download a new app..You’re doing all this anyway — why not get paid for it? With a website called.KashKick.,.you could get paid for things like answering survey questions or downloading and playing a game — up to $500 in your first month..You can earn money by playing games or trying new products and services, but surveys are the main way to make money..Once you earn $10 in your account, you can immediately get paid via Paypal. This is an easy way to make a little extra money while you’re killing time on your couch. All you need is your phone or computer..It takes just a minute to.sign up., and you’ll immediately earn $1 just for completing your profile on the site. You’ll be that much closer to cashing out..7. Get $200 When You Slash Your Home Internet Bill to as Little as $40/Month.There are some bills you just can’t avoid. For most of us, that includes our internet bill. You can’t exactly go without it these days, and your provider knows that — that’s why so many of us are overpaying..But with.T-Mobile., you can get high-speed, 5G home internet for as little as $40 a month. They’ll even guarantee to lock in your price..You’re probably thinking there’s some catch, but they’ll let you try it out for 15 days to see if you like it. If not, you’ll get your money back. You don’t even have to worry about breaking up with your current provider — T-Mobile will pay up to $750 in termination fees..Even better? When you switch now, you’ll get $200 back via prepaid MasterCard..Just.enter your address and phone number here.to see if you qualify. You could be paying as low as $40 a month for high-speed internet..Upvote.·.999.411.999.121.99.18.Related questions.More answers below.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.I have gotten mechatronics at MIT Manipal.

The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago..As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:.1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects. They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc. All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer..2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years. Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books. Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering..3)Placements. I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption. There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot..However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure. There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry.A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) .Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry..Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well..I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal.

The master's degree program is suitable for motivated students with undergraduate degrees in geoscience, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering. The program is designed to be completed in 27 months (two years and a summer). The first year, students matriculate in June and begin research with an advisor before taking classes in September.  In the second year, the student conducts research and thesis work, culminating in a SM thesis. This must be signed off by the advisor and Chair of the disciplinary committee (AOSE or PO).  Within the PO discipline, it is recommended to give a public presentation of the work..GRE Scores are not required for admission to the Joint Program..Application to either discipline includes letters of recommendation, including academic references. Other discipline-specific requirements are described below..1.  For consideration for admission to AOSE, applicants choose the Mechanical Engineering option.  Program requirements are (with A or B grades):.Degree in engineering or physical sciences.Undergraduate preparation in:.Mathematics (through differential equations, advanced courses recommended).Physics (one year).Upper-level courses in specialty.2.  For consideration for admission to PO, program requirements are:.Degree in mathematics or physical sciences..Undergraduate preparation required as prerequisites for Joint Program course 12.800:  Equivalent courses to MIT courses 8.03, 18.03 and 18.04 (with A or B grades):.MIT 8.03.  Physics III.  Mechanical vibrations and waves; simple harmonic motion, superposition, forced vibrations and resonance, coupled oscillations, and normal modes; vibrations of continuous systems; reflection and refraction; phase and group velocity.

Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine..Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it. Start by understanding basic circuits. Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it. This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits..After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems. Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430. I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish..But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming. You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems..Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering. LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects..Upvote.·.99.76.9.5.Related questions.More answers below.How is mechatronics at MIT?.Does MIT offer mechatronics as a course?.Why do universities like Stanford and MIT not have majors in mechatronics?.What Master programs can a mechatronics student go for?.How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?.Aman Arora.Student at Thapar University.·.Author has.74.answers and.183.2K.answer views.·.7y.MIT is a really selective school, with the acceptance rate around 8%.

On university campuses, the Beatles blared from dorm-room stereos, and VW Beetles infested parking lots. The times were a-changing, and they were ripe for bold initiatives..Few initiatives are as bold as an unorthodox marriage—especially in the halls of academia. So it was a bit of a maverick master stroke when two eminent scientific institutions—the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution—announced in 1968 that they had agreed to create a joint program for graduate studies in oceanography..At first blush, the union seemed made in heaven. MIT was the foremost American center of higher education in science and engineering, but it did not offer a full range of ocean sciences and was threatened with becoming literally and figuratively landlocked from an exciting, important, and rapidly emerging field of science. WHOI, on the other hand, literally and figuratively faced the sea, launching research ships and ocean expeditions from its active port in Woods Hole. But it had no shore-based provisions for teaching fundamental science courses and spawning new generations of oceanographers to continue seagoing research..“Woods Hole had a vast laboratory, which was the ocean,” said Howard W. Johnson, who was president of MIT in 1968. “We had the classrooms and the students who were interested in that laboratory. So the connection was natural.”.But if the idea made so much common sense, why hadn’t it been done before? The primary reason was that, well, it had never been done before. It was an unprecedented venture in higher education for two highly successful, fiercely independent institutions to join together, especially ones with such different upbringings..Many scientists at WHOI preferred to conduct their high-seas research without the burdens of teaching and advising students or the constraints imposed by academic bureaucracy, committees, and rules. MIT faculty members had their own qualms. For starters, the idea of sharing its prestigious degree with another institution was new and not something to be entered into lightly. In addition, some academic curmudgeons deemed the young science of oceanography a playground for yachtsmen or a bastard science unworthy of the same degree given to students of more classical fields like physics, biology, and chemistry..A match made in academia.To stem the hemming and hawing and bring MIT and WHOI to the altar required the strong intervention of visionary matchmakers. Among them were Frank Press, head of MIT’s Earth Science Department, who had made several cruises on WHOI’s research ship Atlantis and knew the value of an integrated approach to the earth sciences that included land and oceans. At WHOI, Director Paul Fye rounded up support for the partnership among trustees and gathered funds from private donors to ensure that WHOI could hold up its end financially. J. Seward Johnson gave two gifts totaling $8 million, and Mr. and Mrs. W. Van Alan Clark donated another $5.25 million to launch the new education program..With this dowry promised and a nuptial agreement hammered out, WHOI and MIT were formally wed on May 8, 1968, at a signing ceremony aboard WHOI’s research vessel Chain. The memorandum of agreement joined MIT and WHOI “in a cooperative arrangement in which each institution … will participate as an equal partner.”.This was no merger or acquisition, but a marriage—one that is still going strong after 40 years. In June 2008, the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering awarded its 800th degree, said James Yoder, vice president for academic programs and dean at WHOI. “Many of our graduates are on the faculty at leading U.S. and international universities, research institutes, and colleges. Others work for companies involved in offshore petroleum exploration, are senior officers in the U.S. Navy, hold high positions in the federal government, work in private industry, or have founded their own successful companies.”.In 2004, an external review committee composed of elite scientists and educators from other institutions assessed the program and concluded: “The MIT-WHOI Joint Program remains a (if not the) top educational program covering all the marine sciences and engineering. The leading institutions of marine science around the world have significant representation of graduates of the JP on their staff. The vigour of the program is shown by the quality of students’ research and the very warm feelings they express for the Institutions and people that foster their development.”.Both institutions have profited from the relationship, and so have their offspring—the students. JP students take advantage of the complementary strengths and capabilities of two great institutions.

These responsibilities include recommendations for admissions, annual reviews of academic progress of students enrolled in their area of responsibility, approval by the committee or committee chair of the thesis advisors and thesis committees, chairs of the thesis defense, approval of the final thesis by the Chair of the curriculum committee on behalf of the committee, and advice about all matters of the Joint Program, particularly in their disciplinary areas, to the Co-Chairs of The MIT-WHOI Joint Program Committee..Membership.Members of the curriculum Joint Committees represent their home departments at MIT or at WHOI in both maximizing the effectiveness of the department's participation in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program and maximizing the effectiveness of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program overall..The members of curriculum Joint Committees (JCAOSE, JCBO, JCCO, JCMG&G, JCPO) are appointed from the faculty at MIT and the WHOI Scientific Staff in the various departments at the respective partner institutions (MIT and WHOI) participating in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. Appointments are by the Director of the Joint Program at MIT upon recommendation of the Department Head for faculty from appropriate MIT department(s), and by the Vice President for Academic Programs and Dean at WHOI for members of WHOI Education Assembly, upon the recommendation of the Chair of the appropriate WHOI Department(s)..Terms of appointment are normally three years and are staggered to allow for continuity of experience for committee membership. Members may be reappointed if that is considered to be in the best interest of the specific disciplinary committee and the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. However, normal practice will result in no more than two successive terms of three years each..The WHOI Registrar and Graduate Admissions and Student Affairs Officer, and the Administrator of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program at MIT are members ex-officio of the curriculum committees and at least one of these people may attend the meetings for purposes of record keeping and staffing the meeting..The Vice President for Academic Programs and Dean WHOI, the Director of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program at MIT, and the Associate Dean may attend disciplinary Joint Committee meetings as appropriate for advice, information exchange and discussion with the committee members..The current members are listed in the table below:.Joint Committee for Applied Ocean Science and Engineering (JCAOSE).Alexandra Techet, (Chair).MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering.Julien Bonnel*.WHOI, Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department.John Leonard.MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering.Pierre Lermusiaux.MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering.Heidi Nepf.MIT, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.David Ralston.WHOI, Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department.Russ Tedrake.MIT, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.Brian Williams.MIT, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.Gordon Zhang.WHOI, Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department.Joint Committee for Biological Oceanography (JCBO).Jesús Pineda (Chair).WHOI, Biology Department.Neel Aluru*.WHOI, Biology Department.Gregory Fournier.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Serguei Saavedra.MIT, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.Michelle Shero.WHOI, Biology Department.Brady Weissbourd.MIT, Department of Biology.Joint Committee for Chemical Oceanography (JCCO).Ed Boyle (Chair).MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Colleen Hansel*.WHOI, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department.Amy Apprill.WHOI, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department.Phil Gschwend.MIT, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.Roger Summons.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Shuhei Ono.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.David (Roo) Nicholson.WHOI, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department.Joint Committee for Marine Geology and Geophysics (JCMG&G).Sarah Das (Chair).WHOI, Geology and Geophysics Department.Andrew Ashton*.WHOI, Geology and Geophysics Department.Camilla Cattania.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Andrew Cross.WHOI, Geology and Geophysics Department.Brent Minchew.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Matej Pec.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.Joint Committee for Physical Oceanography (JCPO).Amala Mahadevan (Chair).WHOI, Physical Oceanography Department.Geoffrey 'Jake' Gebbie*.WHOI, Physical Oceanography Department.Robert Todd.WHOI, Physical Oceanography Department.Pierre Lermusiaux.MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering.Glenn Flierl.MIT, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.* WHOI J.
