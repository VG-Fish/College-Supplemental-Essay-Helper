How do I learn Mechatronics?
Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and det

Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and detect possible malfunction
 Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine

Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it
 Start by understanding basic circuits
 Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it
 This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits

After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems
 Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430
 I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish

But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming
 You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems

Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering
 LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects

What are the best project management tools for managers?
As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected—especially in this time of
increased remote work

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected—especially in this time of
increased remote work

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

If you’re managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time
 But keeping track of all the moving pieces quickly gets complicated
 Without a good process for managing multiple projects, it’s hard to know what work to prioritize, how to help your team effectively manage their workload, and whether everything is getting done on time

Fortunately, there is a better way
 Whether you’re struggling to organize and manage work across multiple projects or ensuring your team has a manageable workload,
Asana
can help you keep everything on track

Plan and manage all of your team’s projects in the same place
When your team has a central source of truth, you can move from thinking one project at a time to looking at the entire system in which you operate
 With a bird’s-eye view of everything going on—and how your work connects to broader initiatives—your team can become more effective and less stressed

Rather than wondering who is working on what, searching for a project plan through email, or trying to remember how your team executed the last project, Asana keeps everything organized for you
 With a single source of truth, you and your team can create solid work plans knowing that you can hold each other accountable—and accomplish more with less stress

Prioritize the work that will have the highest impact
It’s hard to get good work done when teams work in silos
 Not only is this bad for productivity, but it’s also bad for motivation and collaboration
 Research shows that when employees have clarity on how their individual work adds value to their organization, they’re
2X more likely
to feel motivated
 Today, it’s more important than ever to have clarity and
visibility into your projects
, in order to connect the dots and empower your collaborators

With Asana, you can do that in a few ways:
Easily identify priority with custom fields

Use High, Medium, or Low priority custom fields to know which tasks are most important
 Sort and schedule work so you know what to work on first

Shift or reschedule tasks—without losing work

Asana makes it easy to change a task’s due date
 And, since all of your work is stored in Asana, you don’t have to worry about those tasks falling through the cracks

Identify your most important work with Milestones

By marking a task in Asana as a Milestone, you can show that it represents an important goal or priority
 That way, your team knows to prioritize the work that helps you achieve that milestone

Identify burnout and prevent overwork
Today,
82% of workers report feeling burned out

 But preventing teams from feeling overworked is a real challenge—especially if you don’t have clarity on what your team is working on

Teams are most efficient and effective when everyone is working on the right amount of the right priorities—at the right time
 With Asana
Workload
, you gain visibility into work happening across projects in a single view
 Rebalance work without the heavy lifting by dragging and dropping tasks within Workload view to reduce burnout before it happens

Manage multiple projects successfully with Asana
As a team lead, managing multiple projects at the same time is often a reality of the job
 Asana can help you keep track of all of your team’s moving pieces, stay organized, hit your deadlines, and achieve your goals

Try Asana for free for 30 days
and get started with the most user-friendly, easy-to-use project management tool for remote teams

MIT is a really selective school, with the acceptance rate around 8%
 So to get into any stream, you will have to be at the top of your game

Get a few research papers published in journals of repute

Get to know your teachers so they write LORs eulogising you, even to the point they go ahead and say that this is the “best kid I have ever taught”

Maintain a good GPA, more than 3
 6 at least on a 4 point scale

Also, best of luck for your future!

To begin with you need to have great score in the GRE Exam, be in top 2 percentile, but marks won't define your admission here, you need to prove that you are Jack of all trades and not just an by harding book monger
 Maybe you can take 2 sports and practice your hobbies to the highest level possible, work for charitable Programs,make your resume blossom with extra curriculars

The 2nd part is that you need to excel in academics too, since you want to work on Mechatronics for masters, you need to excel in working on any type of embedded systems and microprocessors, do some online courses from Coursera or edx, then do some internships
 Whatever you do, defend yourself with a certification, that will help you in the long run

Every day every hour your, turn your pain into power
 I hope we meet there as it says dream too
 All th best, remember even if you don't make it, there is some PhDs you can join later

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (

, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

 Not getting paid for your opinions

As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)

I usually use Branded Surveys (
link here
)
 You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc
 Perfect for when you're watching TV

Here's the form I used to sign up
- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops

7
 Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)

It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)

Times have changed
 There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (
Ark7
is one of our favorites)

They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you
 Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account

It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)

If you’re interested,
take a look at Ark7’s properties here

8
 Not getting paid for your screentime

There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)

I typically use
TesterUp
, but there are others too
 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
 I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly

Here’s a link to the app

Hope that helps someone!

How do I learn Mechatronics?
Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and det

Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and detect possible malfunction
 Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine

Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it
 Start by understanding basic circuits
 Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it
 This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits

After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems
 Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430
 I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish

But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming
 You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems

Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering
 LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects

What are the best project management tools for managers?
As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected—especially in this time of
increased remote work

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

If you’re managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time

As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected—especially in this time of

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

If you’re managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time
 But keeping track of all the moving pieces quickly gets complicated
 Without a good process for managing multiple projects, it’s hard to know what work to prioritize, how to help your team effectively manage their workload, and whether everything is getting done on time

Fortunately, there is a better way
 Whether you’re struggling to organize and manage work across multiple projects or ensuring your team has a manageable workload,
Asana
can help you keep everything on track

Plan and manage all of your team’s projects in the same place
When your team has a central source of truth, you can move from thinking one project at a time to looking at the entire system in which you operate
 With a bird’s-eye view of everything going on—and how your work connects to broader initiatives—your team can become more effective and less stressed

Rather than wondering who is working on what, searching for a project plan through email, or trying to remember how your team executed the last project, Asana keeps everything organized for you
 With a single source of truth, you and your team can create solid work plans knowing that you can hold each other accountable—and accomplish more with less stress

Prioritize the work that will have the highest impact
It’s hard to get good work done when teams work in silos
 Not only is this bad for productivity, but it’s also bad for motivation and collaboration
 Research shows that when employees have clarity on how their individual work adds value to their organization, they’re
2X more likely
to feel motivated
 Today, it’s more important than ever to have clarity and
visibility into your projects
, in order to connect the dots and empower your collaborators

With Asana, you can do that in a few ways:
Easily identify priority with custom fields

Use High, Medium, or Low priority custom fields to know which tasks are most important
 Sort and schedule work so you know what to work on first

Shift or reschedule tasks—without losing work

Asana makes it easy to change a task’s due date
 And, since all of your work is stored in Asana, you don’t have to worry about those tasks falling through the cracks

Identify your most important work with Milestones

By marking a task in Asana as a Milestone, you can show that it represents an important goal or priority
 That way, your team knows to prioritize the work that helps you achieve that milestone

Identify burnout and prevent overwork
Today,
82% of workers report feeling burned out

 But preventing teams from feeling overworked is a real challenge—especially if you don’t have clarity on what your team is working on

Teams are most efficient and effective when everyone is working on the right amount of the right priorities—at the right time
 With Asana
Workload
, you gain visibility into work happening across projects in a single view
 Rebalance work without the heavy lifting by dragging and dropping tasks within Workload view to reduce burnout before it happens

Manage multiple projects successfully with Asana
As a team lead, managing multiple projects at the same time is often a reality of the job
 Asana can help you keep track of all of your team’s moving pieces, stay organized, hit your deadlines, and achieve your goals

Try Asana for free for 30 days
and get started with the most user-friendly, easy-to-use project management tool for remote teams

MIT is a really selective school, with the acceptance rate around 8%
 So to get into any stream, you will have to be at the top of your game

Get a few research papers published in journals of repute

Get to know your teachers so they write LORs eulogising you, even to the point they go ahead and say that this is the “best kid I have ever taught”

Maintain a good GPA, more than 3
 6 at least on a 4 point scale

Also, best of luck for your future!

 Maybe you can take 2 sports and practice your hobbies to the highest level possible, work for charitable Programs,make your resume blossom with extra curriculars

The 2nd part is that you need to excel in academics too, since you want to work on Mechatronics for masters, you need to excel in working on any type of embedded systems and microprocessors, do some online courses from Coursera or edx, then do some internships
 Whatever you do, defend yourself with a certification, that will help you in the long run

Every day every hour your, turn your pain into power
 I hope we meet there as it says dream too
 All th best, remember even if you don't make it, there is some PhDs you can join later

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (

, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping
, if you want

6

I typically use

 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
