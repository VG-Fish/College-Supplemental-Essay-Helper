I would disagree with the answers here

I am myself a Mechatronics Engineer from MIT batch of 2014–2018
 In my last semester I interned at Addverb Technology which deals in Warehouse Automation
 I got the opportunity to work in core field on subjects of path planning, image processing, navigation, etc
 For development of an AGV
 There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers
 The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow

 For development of an AGV
 There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers
 The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields
 Basically the system as a whole

Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest
 I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot
 The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field
 The Labs are world class
 Research is a bit lagging
 Practical exposure is excellent
 But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc
 which is gold if you love robotics

If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field
 Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study
 However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India

I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics
 There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

Where do I start?

 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping
, if you want

6
 Not getting paid for your opinions

As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)

I usually use Branded Surveys (
link here
)
 You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc
 Perfect for when you're watching TV

Here's the form I used to sign up
- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops

7
 Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)

It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)

Times have changed
 There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (
Ark7
is one of our favorites)

They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you
 Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account

It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)

If you’re interested,
take a look at Ark7’s properties here

8
 Not getting paid for your screentime

There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)

I typically use
TesterUp
, but there are others too
 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
 I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly

Here’s a link to the app

Hope that helps someone!

What is studying Mechatronics like?
Since I have completed my masters in mechatronics, this question I asked myself for many times
 Because I study about all

In simple words, Mechatronics is about the complete product
 Example a robot
 It need a mechanical body
 An electronics circuits 
 Program to control it
 Like this if you think about any product in market
 That require all the department of engineering to form as complete product in wide aspect
 So Mechatronics combines these all

If you just want to know the subjects
microprocessor
PLC
Control system
Hydrolic machines
IC engine
Manufacturing and production etc will be covered

How is mechatronics branch at manipal?
Mechatronics branch is quite a new branch of engineering
 It includes mechanical, electrical, electronics, ice, etc
 based subjects
 Hence, the scope of this branch is increasing exponentially, in India as well as abroad

This branch started in Manipal about 10 years ago
 It already has an agreement with Bosch-Rexroth, therefore they have invested in our labs and equipped them with the latest technology and equipment
 We have labs including hydraulics, pneumatics, PLC, sensorics, robotics, etc
 All with the best of material
 Working in these labs would be a very interesting experience

 We have labs including hydraulics, pneumatics, PLC, sensorics, robotics, etc
 All with the best of material
 Working in these labs would be a very interesting experience
 You'll get to work with cylinders, valves, sensors, robotic arm and a lot of other things

The subjects are interesting and tough
 Scoring marks isn't a very easy job, but you would enjoy understanding the concepts and then applying them into automation and robotics

The faculty is okay
 Some of them are extremely good and interested in teaching, but some are just irritated souls who come and takeout their frustration in college
 The HOD belongs to the latter category, sadly!
Nevertheless, all the faculty members are very helpful!
The placements aren't very good, but considering it's still a growing branch in India, the future is bright in the industry
So, in conclusion, mechatronics in MIT, Manipal is a brilliant choice and you should go ahead with it unless you're getting some core branch here, then you should still weigh your options once
I hope this helped you!
PS- I am in 4th year mechatronics engineering in MIT

How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?
MIT, Manipal is one of the few colleges that provide an education in Mechatronics Engineering
 The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago

As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:
1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects
 They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors

As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:
1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects
 They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc
 All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer

2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years
 Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books
 Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering

3)Placements
 I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption
 There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot

However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure
 There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry
A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) 
Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry

Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well

I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal
 Hope it helps

What are the best productivity hacks, tips, tools or resources for a project manager?
At
Asana
, we’ve spent years developing the best
work management platform
for team management and collaboration, which we believe is the backbone of productivity
 When your team is organized and connected, you can improve productivity, reduce “
work about work
” like ineffective meetings and email bloat, and do better work

So if you’re looking to avoid the roadblocks that hinder productivity for even the best of teams, look no further

At
Asana
, we’ve spent years developing the best
work management platform
for team management and collaboration, which we believe is the backbone of productivity
 When your team is organized and connected, you can improve productivity, reduce “
work about work
” like ineffective meetings and email bloat, and do better work

So if you’re looking to avoid the roadblocks that hinder productivity for even the best of teams, look no further
 Here are eight tips for improving team organization and connection and—in turn—boosting both the speed and quality of your team’s work:
Eliminate unnecessary meetings
Meetings are productive if and when there’s a clear agenda, the right people attend, and everyone is prepared to contribute to a solution
 However, if this isn’t the case, even short meetings can add up and eat into time your team has to work toward tangible goals

To avoid that, share a
meeting agenda
in Asana beforehand so everyone is on the same page
 Create sections where collaborators can ask async questions and identify the work that’s most important to talk about
 After the meeting, identify action items within the same Asana project, so no work falls through the cracks

Prioritize work based on key results
Employees have many important tasks across multiple projects, but it can be hard for team members to know where they should devote the bulk of their time and brainpower
 With Asana
custom fields
, assign each task a priority or status level
 That way team members can prioritize work that ladders up to company-wide objectives

Having a well-defined set of goals and clear understanding of
how work ladders up to those goals
will empower team members to make decisions that impact the big picture
 And, if a project isn’t connected to a larger company goal, rethink whether it’s necessary or not in the first place

Delete, defer, delegate, or diminish
Asana surveyed over 10,000 global workers to find out
how we really spend our time at work

 We found that a surprisingly small portion of the day actually goes toward skilled work and big-picture planning
 To eliminate the busywork standing between you and substantive tasks, remember the four D’s:
If an aspect of a project does not support an overarching company goal—delete it

If there is a more pressing project that has a greater impact on team goals, complete that task and defer a less important task for when you have more time

If there are two tasks of equal importance assigned to one person, delegate one of those tasks to another team member with more bandwidth

If there’s a task you can’t defer, delete, or delegate, find ways to diminish the amount of time it takes to complete
 For example, you can eliminate related meetings or work on just the highest priority parts of the task

Leverage your team’s strengths
No two employees are alike
 Each person has different experiences, strengths, and weaknesses that make them a valued member of your team
 When assigning work, be sure each individual’s task is one they are not only suited for, but also will enjoy completing
 Giving your team tasks they find personally rewarding or challenging can help everyone to do their best work

Additionally, proactively identify and prevent burnout so your team is always doing their best work

Workload
allows team members to assign time or capacity to tasks, so you can preemptively address overwork
 Reassign tasks and rebalance responsibilities to make sure your team gets the right work done at the right time

Map out a plan before beginning
Once you know what needs to be done and who will do it, you then need to define a well-thought plan that can eliminate “work about work,” like status updates and email bloat
 Start by establishing a clear timeline for each project, and make sure everyone knows who’s doing what by when

Using a work management tool can help you set up all of the smaller tasks that lead to accomplishing a larger goal
 Making use of
existing or custom templates
in Asana can help you replicate a process that’s worked before and be certain nothing slips through the cracks

Encourage cross-functional collaboration
Just because you work in a different department doesn’t mean you can’t work together
 After all, you’re working toward the same goal as part of a larger company
 Knowing what other teams are working on can
encourage teams to collaborate
with one another when work and goals overlap

Work management tools can increase cross-team visibility, mapping each phase of a project back to a singular set of goals
 These tools can serve as a centralized hub to share what you’re working on with the rest of the team and identify areas where people of different responsibilities can collaborate

Promote no-meeting days
Meetings can disrupt your flow, making it harder to “get in the zone” and finish a project
 Having at least one full day devoted to deep work—that sweet, sweet block of several uninterrupted hours—can go a long way toward improving efficiency and productivity

At Asana, we have No Meeting Wednesday, which allows everyone to be heads-down in work instead of just talking about work
 As a result, the team has more time to execute critical processes on projects
 Many employees cite No Meeting Wednesday as their favorite day of the week and often see projects cross the finish line on Hump Day

Alternatively, give your team more freedom to set their own deep work blocks with Asana features like
Do Not Disturb

 Notify your team that you’re working but not receiving notifications, and keep clear lines of communication open

Define the purpose of different communication channels
Communication tools are only useful if your team knows how and when to use them
 Using them inconsistently or having multiple channels for the same use can actually create more confusion and inefficiency than the tools were meant to eliminate in the first place

It’s important to clearly define the purpose of each communication channel
 For example, this is how we use communication tools at Asana:
For outside communication with vendors and clients, stick to email

For immediate answers to questions, use an app like
Slack


To plan, manage, and communicate about actionable work, stick to a
work management tool like Asana


Improving team collaboration and connection increases productivity
Improving productivity is a continuous process
 It may seem overwhelming, but simple organization tools and collaboration tactics can help make everyone on your team more connected—and more efficient

Asana
can help make you and your team be more efficient, and try Asana for free today

How do I learn Mechatronics?
Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and det

Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and detect possible malfunction
 Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine

Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it
 Start by understanding basic circuits
 Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it
 This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits

After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems
 Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430
 I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish

But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming
 You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems

Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering
 LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (

, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping
, if you want

6
 Not getting paid for your opinions

As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)

I usually use Branded Surveys (
link here
)
 You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc
 Perfect for when you're watching TV

Here's the form I used to sign up
- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops

7
 Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)

It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)

Times have changed
 There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (
Ark7
is one of our favorites)

They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you
 Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account

It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)

If you’re interested,
take a look at Ark7’s properties here

8
 Not getting paid for your screentime

There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)

I typically use
TesterUp
, but there are others too
 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
 I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly

Here’s a link to the app

Hope that helps someone!

MIT is a really selective school, with the acceptance rate around 8%
 So to get into any stream, you will have to be at the top of your game

Get a few research papers published in journals of repute

Get to know your teachers so they write LORs eulogising you, even to the point they go ahead and say that this is the “best kid I have ever taught”

Maintain a good GPA, more than 3
 6 at least on a 4 point scale

Also, best of luck for your future!

 Maybe you can take 2 sports and practice your hobbies to the highest level possible, work for charitable Programs,make your resume blossom with extra curriculars

The 2nd part is that you need to excel in academics too, since you want to work on Mechatronics for masters, you need to excel in working on any type of embedded systems and microprocessors, do some online courses from Coursera or edx, then do some internships
 Whatever you do, defend yourself with a certification, that will help you in the long run

As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected—especially in this time of
increased remote work

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

If you’re managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time
 But keeping track of all the moving pieces quickly gets complicated
 Without a good process for managing multiple projects, it’s hard to know what work to prioritize, how to help your team effectively manage their workload, and whether everything is getting done on time

Fortunately, there is a better way
 Whether you’re struggling to organize and manage work across multiple projects or ensuring your team has a manageable workload,
Asana
can help you keep everything on track

Plan and manage all of your team’s projects in the same place
When your team has a central source of truth, you can move from thinking one project at a time to looking at the entire system in which you operate
 With a bird’s-eye view of everything going on—and how your work connects to broader initiatives—your team can become more effective and less stressed

Rather than wondering who is working on what, searching for a project plan through email, or trying to remember how your team executed the last project, Asana keeps everything organized for you
 With a single source of truth, you and your team can create solid work plans knowing that you can hold each other accountable—and accomplish more with less stress

Prioritize the work that will have the highest impact
It’s hard to get good work done when teams work in silos
 Not only is this bad for productivity, but it’s also bad for motivation and collaboration
 Research shows that when employees have clarity on how their individual work adds value to their organization, they’re
2X more likely
to feel motivated
 Today, it’s more important than ever to have clarity and
visibility into your projects
, in order to connect the dots and empower your collaborators

With Asana, you can do that in a few ways:
Easily identify priority with custom fields

Use High, Medium, or Low priority custom fields to know which tasks are most important
 Sort and schedule work so you know what to work on first

Shift or reschedule tasks—without losing work

Asana makes it easy to change a task’s due date
 And, since all of your work is stored in Asana, you don’t have to worry about those tasks falling through the cracks

Identify your most important work with Milestones

By marking a task in Asana as a Milestone, you can show that it represents an important goal or priority
 That way, your team knows to prioritize the work that helps you achieve that milestone

Identify burnout and prevent overwork
Today,
82% of workers report feeling burned out

 But preventing teams from feeling overworked is a real challenge—especially if you don’t have clarity on what your team is working on

Teams are most efficient and effective when everyone is working on the right amount of the right priorities—at the right time

How do I learn Mechatronics?
Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and det

Mechatronics is divided into three main subjects Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, so you should learn about each subject and then learn how to integrate them in one project by learning about Control Systems Engineering

To learn how to design mechanical components and mechanisms you need knowledge about mainly two things

Machine design: witch can be defined as the process by which energy is converted into useful mechanical forms

Mechanical CAD software: You should be able to use a CAD software So that you can design and visualize mechanisms and through simulation analyze and detect possible malfunction
 Then the model can also be brought to life by using a 3D printer or a CNC machine

Knowing about electronics is essential since you can’t program a mechanical machine without embedding electronics in it to control it
 Start by understanding basic circuits
 Later you can practice using two methods Either Get a breadboard and some electronic components like resistors, capacitors and inductors start making simple projects, also there is a great software named Proteus Design Suite you can design and simulate circuits using virtual components in it
 This is suitable when you advance and want to design more complicated circuits

After gaining solid knowledge about basic electronics you can start learning about embedded systems
 Get a microcontroller like the TI MSP430
 I recomend this microcontroller because there are plenty of courses and books for it, of course you can choose any other microcontroller if you wish

But you can’t use a microcontroller without a knowledge of computer architecture and programming
 You need to start learning the C programming language it is the most suitable for low level programming and the default programming language for embedded systems

Finally learn about control theory of systems, which is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering
 LabView will help you apply that knowledge, it is a software designed for fast development of any engineering application that require measurement and control making it very suitable for mechatronics projects

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

Where do I start?

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping
, if you want

6
 Not getting paid for your opinions

As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)

I usually use Branded Surveys (
link here
)
 You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc
 Perfect for when you're watching TV

Here's the form I used to sign up
- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops

7
 Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)

It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)

Times have changed
 There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (
Ark7
is one of our favorites)

They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you
 Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account

It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)

If you’re interested,
take a look at Ark7’s properties here

8
 Not getting paid for your screentime

There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)

I typically use
TesterUp
, but there are others too
 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
 I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly

Here’s a link to the app

Hope that helps someone!

MIT is a really selective school, with the acceptance rate around 8%
 So to get into any stream, you will have to be at the top of your game

Get a few research papers published in journals of repute

Get to know your teachers so they write LORs eulogising you, even to the point they go ahead and say that this is the “best kid I have ever taught”

Maintain a good GPA, more than 3
 6 at least on a 4 point scale

Also, best of luck for your future!

To begin with you need to have great score in the GRE Exam, be in top 2 percentile, but marks won't define your admission here, you need to prove that you are Jack of all trades and not just an by harding book monger
 Maybe you can take 2 sports and practice your hobbies to the highest level possible, work for charitable Programs,make your resume blossom with extra curriculars

The 2nd part is that you need to excel in academics too, since you want to work on Mechatronics for masters, you need to excel in working on any type of embedded systems and microprocessors, do some online courses from Coursera or edx, then do some internships
 Whatever you do, defend yourself with a certification, that will help you in the long run

Every day every hour your, turn your pain into power
 I hope we meet there as it says dream too
 All th best, remember even if you don't make it, there is some PhDs you can join later

 Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana’s clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere

If you’re managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time
 But keeping track of all the moving pieces quickly gets complicated
 Without a good process for managing multiple projects, it’s hard to know what work to prioritize, how to help your team effectively manage their workload, and whether everything is getting done on time

Fortunately, there is a better way
 Whether you’re struggling to organize and manage work across multiple projects or ensuring your team has a manageable workload,
Asana
can help you keep everything on track

Plan and manage all of your team’s projects in the same place
When your team has a central source of truth, you can move from thinking one project at a time to looking at the entire system in which you operate
 With a bird’s-eye view of everything going on—and how your work connects to broader initiatives—your team can become more effective and less stressed

Rather than wondering who is working on what, searching for a project plan through email, or trying to remember how your team executed the last project, Asana keeps everything organized for you
 With a single source of truth, you and your team can create solid work plans knowing that you can hold each other accountable—and accomplish more with less stress

Prioritize the work that will have the highest impact
It’s hard to get good work done when teams work in silos
 Not only is this bad for productivity, but it’s also bad for motivation and collaboration
 Research shows that when employees have clarity on how their individual work adds value to their organization, they’re
2X more likely
to feel motivated
 Today, it’s more important than ever to have clarity and
visibility into your projects
, in order to connect the dots and empower your collaborators

With Asana, you can do that in a few ways:
Easily identify priority with custom fields

Use High, Medium, or Low priority custom fields to know which tasks are most important
 Sort and schedule work so you know what to work on first

Shift or reschedule tasks—without losing work

Asana makes it easy to change a task’s due date
 And, since all of your work is stored in Asana, you don’t have to worry about those tasks falling through the cracks

Identify your most important work with Milestones

By marking a task in Asana as a Milestone, you can show that it represents an important goal or priority
 That way, your team knows to prioritize the work that helps you achieve that milestone

Identify burnout and prevent overwork
Today,
82% of workers report feeling burned out

 But preventing teams from feeling overworked is a real challenge—especially if you don’t have clarity on what your team is working on

Teams are most efficient and effective when everyone is working on the right amount of the right priorities—at the right time
 With Asana
Workload
, you gain visibility into work happening across projects in a single view
 Rebalance work without the heavy lifting by dragging and dropping tasks within Workload view to reduce burnout before it happens

Manage multiple projects successfully with Asana
As a team lead, managing multiple projects at the same time is often a reality of the job
 Asana can help you keep track of all of your team’s moving pieces, stay organized, hit your deadlines, and achieve your goals

Try Asana for free for 30 days
and get started with the most user-friendly, easy-to-use project management tool for remote teams

I would disagree with the answers here

I am myself a Mechatronics Engineer from MIT batch of 2014–2018
 In my last semester I interned at Addverb Technology which deals in Warehouse Automation
 I got the opportunity to work in core field on subjects of path planning, image processing, navigation, etc
 For development of an AGV
 There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers

 For development of an AGV
 There are many core companies in Delhi, Pune and Bangalore that needs mechatronics engineers
 The traditional industries as a whole haven't yet recognized this branch very much but automation is growing rapidly and so will the requirement of Mechatronics engineers grow as for such jobs you need to have basic knowledge of multitude of fields
 Basically the system as a whole

Also, Mechatronics is a great platform from where you can do a specialized program abroad according to the subject of your interest
 I got accepted to MS program in Robotics at UPenn which is an Ivy league university and my field helped me a lot
 The faculty at Manipal are young and extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the field
 The Labs are world class
 Research is a bit lagging
 Practical exposure is excellent
 But We get to work on mobile autonomous robots, 6 degree industrial robots , PLCs , automation systems , etc
 which is gold if you love robotics

If you are planning to study abroad, I would definitely recommend Mechatronics field
 Currently Payscale in India is surely limited compared to the fields like CS/IT but that shouldn't be a big concern if you plan to go abroad to study
 However in the next 4 years Mechatronics will surely have much better prospects even in India

I would recommend you to take up the field if you are passionate about understanding systems and Robotics
 There are many opportunities in countries like USA, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Switzerland for MS in fields related to Mecharonics and Robotics

What are some financial mistakes the majority of Americans make?
Where do I start?
I spend a LOT of time talking to people about their spending habits
 Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:
1
 Not paying off credit card debt

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

Debt can make you feel hopeless – even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt

But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (
National Debt Relief
, for example) are willing to help you with your debt

Here’s how it typically works:
You typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc
 combined)

A company like
National Debt Relief
(there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks, etc
 to try and reduce your debt

A lot of times you’ll end up paying less than you owe
 Here’s an example from
NDR
’s site:
*E
g
 Angelic was $43,144 in debt and ended up saving around $11k after working with NDR

If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so

Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate
, if you’re interested

See if you qualify for debt relief

2
 Not getting a financial advisor

99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake

Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right
 There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time

People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year
(according to a 2019 Vanguard Study)
 That can make a huge difference over time

But more important:
a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of
If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like
WiserAdvisor
) and find somebody near you that has good reviews

Or if you want something easier,
here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs

3
 Not using an ad blocker

If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am
begging
you to try one
 I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life

A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet

No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc
 It’s incredible

Most people I know use Total Adblock (
link here
) – it’s $2
42/month, but there are plenty of solid options

Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)
 They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice

Here’s a link to Total Adblock
, if you’re interested

4
 Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year

The average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance

Check out a site like
Coverage
com
to compare the best car insurance options available

Answer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today

See how much you could save

5
 Getting price gouged on the internet

You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere

Big stores like Amazon know that
no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites
, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices

I typically
hate
browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have
Capital One Shopping
installed yet, do yourself a favor and
grab it


Here’s what I mean:
I tried to buy this blender on Amazon a few weeks back
 Amazon’s price was $95

(Savings will vary of course, this is just an example)
That exact same blender was $26 cheaper at another store (with 2 day shipping)

It’s saved me a decent amount of money more than once

Here’s a link to install Capital One Shopping
, if you want

6
 Not getting paid for your opinions

As a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well)

I usually use Branded Surveys (
link here
)
 You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc
 Perfect for when you're watching TV

Here's the form I used to sign up
- I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops

7
 Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20)

It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some)

Times have changed
 There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (
Ark7
is one of our favorites)

They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you
 Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account

It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate)

If you’re interested,
take a look at Ark7’s properties here

8
 Not getting paid for your screentime

There are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too)

I typically use
TesterUp
, but there are others too
 It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you
 I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly

Here’s a link to the app

Hope that helps someone!

What is studying Mechatronics like?
Since I have completed my masters in mechatronics, this question I asked myself for many times
 Because I study about all

In simple words, Mechatronics is about the complete product
 Example a robot
 It need a mechanical body
 An electronics circuits 
 Program to control it
 Like this if you think about any product in market
 That require all the department of engineering to form as complete product in wide aspect
 So Mechatronics combines these all

If you just want to know the subjects
microprocessor
PLC
Control system
Hydrolic machines

 We have labs including hydraulics, pneumatics, PLC, sensorics, robotics, etc
 All with the best of material
 Working in these labs would be a very interesting experience
 You'll get to work with cylinders, valves, sensors, robotic arm and a lot of other things

The subjects are interesting and tough
 Scoring marks isn't a very easy job, but you would enjoy understanding the concepts and then applying them into automation and robotics

The faculty is okay
 Some of them are extremely good and interested in teaching, but some are just irritated souls who come and takeout their frustration in college
 The HOD belongs to the latter category, sadly!
Nevertheless, all the faculty members are very helpful!
The placements aren't very good, but considering it's still a growing branch in India, the future is bright in the industry
So, in conclusion, mechatronics in MIT, Manipal is a brilliant choice and you should go ahead with it unless you're getting some core branch here, then you should still weigh your options once
I hope this helped you!
PS- I am in 4th year mechatronics engineering in MIT

How good is mechatronics engineering at MIT, Manipal?
MIT, Manipal is one of the few colleges that provide an education in Mechatronics Engineering
 The department was branched in Mechanical Engineering earlier, and was separated out 3 years ago

As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:
1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects
 They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors

As a student here, i would say this was my best choice (considering i was planning to take up mechatronics at VIT) Why? I would like to briefly explain few points:
1)The course is amazing, and yes involves both mechanical and electronics subjects
 They breeze through some topics which mechanical guys would study for two semesters, while also focus on parts like Programmable Logic Control/ Microprocessors,Electrical Drives, Machine Elements and CAD design etc
 All the topics are covered upto sufficient level of requirement of an engineer

2)Facilities: We get to use the labs from about 5-6 departments over three years
 Apart from which, there are organizaions like International Society of Automation and IE mechatronics which do provide a source for knowledge we wont find in our books
 Not only these two, but the college has several projects like A student Satellite project, An F1 car team, a Solar Car team, Robotics team, all of which involve quite a large margin of mechatronics engineering

3)Placements
 I will speak the truth, it is hard for me as well, but mechatronics placements in India is tougher than getting our political system free of corruption
 There are few instrumentation and controls/ Electronics engineering and sometimes automobile companies that recruit students, but if you compare to other branches, it may seem like you and your batch mates look like the dumber lot

However, i can assure you one thing, getting into mechatronics by choice and not by force will put you in a better place for sure
 There are several passionate mechatronics alumini i know who are on the verge of bringing a grand impact to the industry
A pass outs from this year (2014) have started a desktop 3D printing company(fracktal works) and another group of students formed a robotics company (Vulcantronics) 
Both of which have gained publicity for being a quality new name in the industry

Mechatronics from manipal does make it to the news with students which promise growth of this emerging field and a supportive department as well

I have given you an overallview of thos course in manipal
 Hope it helps

At
Asana
, we’ve spent years developing the best
work management platform
for team management and collaboration, which we believe is the backbone of productivity
 When your team is organized and connected, you can improve productivity, reduce “
work about work
” like ineffective meetings and email bloat, and do better work

So if you’re looking to avoid the roadblocks that hinder productivity for even the best of teams, look no further
 Here are eight tips for improving team organization and connection and—in turn—boosting both the speed and quality of your team’s work:
Eliminate unnecessary meetings
Meetings are productive if and when there’s a clear agenda, the right people attend, and everyone is prepared to contribute to a solution
 However, if this isn’t the case, even short meetings can add up and eat into time your team has to work toward tangible goals

To avoid that, share a
meeting agenda
in Asana beforehand so everyone is on the same page
 Create sections where collaborators can ask async questions and identify the work that’s most important to talk about
 After the meeting, identify action items within the same Asana project, so no work falls through the cracks

Prioritize work based on key results
Employees have many important tasks across multiple projects, but it can be hard for team members to know where they should devote the bulk of their time and brainpower
 With Asana
custom fields
, assign each task a priority or status level
 That way team members can prioritize work that ladders up to company-wide objectives

Having a well-defined set of goals and clear understanding of
how work ladders up to those goals
will empower team members to make decisions that impact the big picture
 And, if a project isn’t connected to a larger company goal, rethink whether it’s necessary or not in the first place

Delete, defer, delegate, or diminish
Asana surveyed over 10,000 global workers to find out
how we really spend our time at work

 We found that a surprisingly small portion of the day actually goes toward skilled work and big-picture planning
 To eliminate the busywork standing between you and substantive tasks, remember the four D’s:
If an aspect of a project does not support an overarching company goal—delete it

If there is a more pressing project that has a greater impact on team goals, complete that task and defer a less important task for when you have more time

If there are two tasks of equal importance assigned to one person, delegate one of those tasks to another team member with more bandwidth

If there’s a task you can’t defer, delete, or delegate, find ways to diminish the amount of time it takes to complete
 For example, you can eliminate related meetings or work on just the highest priority parts of the task

Leverage your team’s strengths
No two employees are alike
 Each person has different experiences, strengths, and weaknesses that make them a valued member of your team
 When assigning work, be sure each individual’s task is one they are not only suited for, but also will enjoy completing
 Giving your team tasks they find personally rewarding or challenging can help everyone to do their best work

Additionally, proactively identify and prevent burnout so your team is always doing their best work

Workload
allows team members to assign time or capacity to tasks, so you can preemptively address overwork
 Reassign tasks and rebalance responsibilities to make sure your team gets the right work done at the right time

Map out a plan before beginning
Once you know what needs to be done and who will do it, you then need to define a well-thought plan that can eliminate “work about work,” like status updates and email bloat
 Start by establishing a clear timeline for each project, and make sure everyone knows who’s doing what by when

Using a work management tool can help you set up all of the smaller tasks that lead to accomplishing a larger goal
 Making use of
existing or custom templates
in Asana can help you replicate a process that’s worked before and be certain nothing slips through the cracks

Encourage cross-functional collaboration
Just because you work in a different department doesn’t mean you can’t work together
 After all, you’re working toward the same goal as part of a larger company
 Knowing what other teams are working on can
encourage teams to collaborate
with one another when work and goals overlap

Work management tools can increase cross-team visibility, mapping each phase of a project back to a singular set of goals
 These tools can serve as a centralized hub to share what you’re working on with the rest of the team and identify areas where people of different responsibilities can collaborate

Promote no-meeting days
Meetings can disrupt your flow, making it harder to “get in the zone” and finish a project
 Having at least one full day devoted to deep work—that sweet, sweet block of several uninterrupted hours—can go a long way toward improving efficiency and productivity

At Asana, we have No Meeting Wednesday, which allows everyone to be heads-down in work instead of just talking about work
 As a result, the team has more time to execute critical processes on projects
 Many employees cite No Meeting Wednesday as their favorite day of the week and often see projects cross the finish line on Hump Day

Alternatively, give your team more freedom to set their own deep work blocks with Asana features like
Do Not Disturb

 Notify your team that you’re working but not receiving notifications, and keep clear lines of communication open

Define the purpose of different communication channels
Communication tools are only useful if your team knows how and when to use them
 Using them inconsistently or having multiple channels for the same use can actually create more confusion and inefficiency than the tools were meant to eliminate in the first place

It’s important to clearly define the purpose of each communication channel
 For example, this is how we use communication tools at Asana:
For outside communication with vendors and clients, stick to email

For immediate answers to questions, use an app like
Slack


To plan, manage, and communicate about actionable work, stick to a
work management tool like Asana

Department of Mechanical Engineering
Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate
Research Centers
Faculty/Staff
Subjects
Mechanical engineering is concerned with the responsible development of products, processes, and power, at scales ranging from molecules to large and complex systems
 Mechanical engineering principles and skills are involved at some stage during the conception, design, development, and manufacture of every human-made object with moving parts
 Many innovations crucial to our future will have their roots in the world of mass, motion, forces, and energy—the world of mechanical engineers

Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest and most versatile of the engineering professions
 This is reflected in the portfolio of current activities in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE), one that has widened rapidly in the past decade
 Today, our faculty are involved in a wide range of projects, including designing tough hydrogels, using nanostructured surfaces for clean water and thermal management of microelectronics, developing efficient methods for robust design, the building of robotics for land and underwater exploration, creating optimization methods that autonomously generate decision-making strategies, developing driverless cars, inventing cost-effective photovoltaic cells, developing thermal and electrical energy storage systems, using acoustics to explore the ocean of one of Jupiter's moons, studying the biomimetics of swimming fish for underwater sensing applications, developing physiological models for metastatic cancers, inventing novel medical devices, exploring 3D printing of nanostructures and macrostructures, and developing coatings to create nonstick surfaces

The department carries out its mission with a focus on the seven areas of excellence described below
 Our education and research agendas are informed by these areas, and these are the areas in which we seek to impassion the best undergraduate and graduate students

Area 1: Mechanics: Modeling, Experimentation, and Computation (MMEC)

At the heart of mechanical engineering lies the ability to measure, describe, and model the physical world of materials and mechanisms
 The MMEC area focuses on teaching the fundamental principles, essential skills, and scientific tools necessary for predicting thermo-mechanical phenomena and using such knowledge in rational engineering design
 We provide students with the foundations in experimental, modeling, and computational skills needed to understand, exploit, and enhance the thermo-physical behavior of advanced engineering devices and systems, and to make lifelong creative contributions at the forefront of the mechanical sciences and beyond
 Research in the MMEC area focuses on four key thrusts:
Computational mechanics
Fluid dynamics and transport
Mechanics of solid materials
Nonlinear dynamics
The fundamental engineering principles embodied in these topics can be applied over a vast range of force, time, and length scales, and applications of interest in the MMEC area span the spectrum from the nano/micro world to the geophysical domain
 A Course 2-A track is offered in this area

Area 2: Design, Manufacturing, and Product Development

Design, manufacturing, and product development is the complete set of activities needed to bring new devices and technologies to the marketplace
 These activities span the entire product life-cycle, from the identification of a market opportunity or need, through design, testing, manufacture and distribution, and end of useful life
 Our work includes everything from understanding the voice of the customer to finding new ways of processing materials to improving product performance and tracking product flow through a distribution network
 A central component of this area is the design and construction of novel equipment, either for consumer products or for industrial uses
 This spans scales from meters to microns, and involves mechanical, electronic and electromechanical devices
 Many MechE students apply design, manufacturing, and product development skills and techniques to extracurricular design work for organizations and student activities such as Design that Matters, Formula SAE, Satellite Engineering Team, and the Solar Electric Vehicle Team
 Some projects lead to flagship products for new companies
 A Course 2-A track in product development is offered along with a unique Master of Engineering degree in manufacturing

Area 3: Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics

The mission in this area is to promote research and education for automating, monitoring, and manipulating systems
 The focus is on system-level behavior that emerges primarily from interactions and cannot be explained from individual component behavior alone
 We seek to identify fundamental principles and methodologies that enable systems to exhibit intelligent, goal-oriented behavior, and develop innovative instruments to monitor, manipulate, and control systems
 The core competencies in which we seek to excel are:
Methodologies for understanding system behavior through physical modeling, identification, and estimation

Technologies for sensors and sensor networks; actuators and energy transducers; and systems for monitoring, processing, and communicating information

Fundamental theories and methodologies for analyzing, synthesizing, and controlling systems; learning and adapting to unknown environments; and effectively achieving task goals

We seek to apply our core competencies to diverse areas of social, national, and global needs
 These include health care, security, education, medical and security related imaging, space and ocean exploration, and autonomous systems in air, land, and underwater environments
 We also offer a Course 2-A track in this area

Area 4: Energy Science and Engineering

Energy is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity and is a central focus of mechanical engineering's contribution to society
 Our research focuses on efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion and utilization from fossil and renewable resources
 Programs in the department cover many of the fundamental and technological aspects of energy, with applications to high performance combustion engines, batteries and fuel cells, thermoelectricity and photovoltaics, wind turbines, and efficient buildings
 Work in very-low-temperature thermodynamics includes novel sub-Kelvin refrigeration
 Efforts in high-temperature thermodynamics and its coupling with transport and chemistry include internal combustion engine analysis, design, and technology; control of combustion dynamics and emissions; thermoelectric energy conversion; low- and high-temperature fuel cells; and novel materials for rechargeable batteries and thermal energy storage
 Work in heat and mass transport covers thermal control of electronics from manufacturing to end use; microscale and nanoscale transport phenomena; desalination and water purification; high heat flux engineering; and energy-efficient building technology
 Work in renewable energy encompasses the design of offshore and floating wind turbines and tidal wave machines; and analysis and manufacturing of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic devices
 Energy storage, hybrid systems, fuel synthesis, and integration of energy systems are active research areas in the department
 We also offer a Course 2-A track in energy

Area 5: Ocean Science and Engineering

The oceans cover over 70 percent of the planet's surface and constitute a critical element in our quality of life, including the climate and the resources and food that we obtain from the sea
 This area's objectives are to support the undergraduate and graduate programs in ocean engineering, including the naval construction program, the MIT/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Applied Oceanography and the Course 2-OE degree in mechanical and ocean engineering
 It also serves as the focus point of ocean-related research and education at MIT
 Major current research activities include marine robotics and navigation of underwater vehicles and smart sensors for ocean mapping and exploration; biomimetics to extract new understanding for the development of novel ocean systems studying marine animals; the study of the mechanics and fluid mechanics of systems for ultradeep ocean gas and oil extraction; ocean wave and offshore wind energy extraction; the free surface hydrodynamics of ocean-going vehicles; the development of advanced naval and commercial ships and submersibles, including the all-electric ship; the mechanics and crashworthiness of ocean ships and structures; ocean transportation systems; ocean acoustics for communication, detection, and mapping in the ocean; and adaptive sampling and multidisciplinary forecasting of the ocean behavior
 The design of complex ocean systems permeates all these areas and provides the cohesive link for our research and teaching activities

Area 6: Bioengineering

Engineering analysis, design, and synthesis are needed to understand biological processes and to harness them successfully for human use
 Mechanical forces and structures play an essential role in governing the function of cells, tissues, and organs
 Our research emphasizes integration of molecular-to-systems–level approaches to probe the behavior of natural biological systems, and to design and build new systems, ranging from analysis of gene regulatory networks to microfluidic assays for drug screening or new technologies for quantitative, high-throughput biomedical imaging
 Emphasis is also placed on creating new physiological or disease models, including multicellular engineered living systems, using nano- and micro-fabrication as well as new biomaterials
 Applications include understanding, diagnosing, and treating diseases such as atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, spinal cord injury or liver failure; new tools for drug discovery and drug development; and tissue-engineered scaffolds and devices for in vivo regeneration of tissues and organs
 Work also includes design and fabrication of new devices and tools for rehabilitation of stroke victims and for robotic surgery
 We offer many elective subjects at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as a bioengineering track in Course 2-A

Area 7: Nano/Micro Science and Technology

The miniaturization of devices and systems of ever-increasing complexity has been a fascinating and productive engineering endeavor during the past few decades
 Near and long term, this trend will be amplified as physical understanding of the nano world expands, and widespread commercial demand drives the application of manufacturing to micro- and nanosystems
 Micro- and nanotechnology can have tremendous impact on a wide range of mechanical systems
 Examples include microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices and products that are already deployed as automobile airbag sensors, smart phone parts, and for drug delivery; stronger and lighter nanostructured materials now used in airplanes and automobiles; and nanostructured energy conversion devices that significantly improve the efficiency of renewable energy systems
 Research in this area cuts across mechanical engineering and other disciplines
 Examples include sensors and actuators; micro-fluidics, heat transfer, and energy conversion at the micro- and nanoscales; optical and biological micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS); engineered nanomaterials; atomic scale precision engineering; and the nano-phoptonics in measurement, sensing, and systems design
 Students interested in micro/nano technology are encouraged to explore the Course 2-A nanoengineering track

In order to prepare the mechanical engineers of the future, the department has developed undergraduate and graduate educational programs of the depth and breadth necessary to address the diverse and rapidly changing technological challenges that society faces
 Our educational programs combine the rigor of academic study with the excitement and creativity inherent to innovation and research

Undergraduate Study
The Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) offers three programs of undergraduate study
 The first of these, the traditional program that leads to the bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, is a more structured program that prepares students for a broad range of career choices in the field of mechanical engineering
 The second program leads to a bachelor's degree in engineering and is intended for students whose career objectives require greater flexibility
 It allows them to combine the essential elements of the traditional mechanical engineering program with study in another, complementary field
 The third program, in mechanical and ocean engineering, is also a structured program for students interested in mechanical engineering as it applies to the engineering aspects of ocean science, exploration, and utilization, and of marine transportation

All of the educational programs in the department prepare students for professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing technology
 They combine a strong base in the engineering sciences (mechanics, materials, fluid and thermal sciences, systems and control) with project-based laboratory and design experiences
 All strive to develop independence, creative talent, and leadership, as well as the capability for continuing professional growth

Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (Course 2)
The program in mechanical engineering provides a broad intellectual foundation in the field of mechanical engineering
 The program develops the relevant engineering fundamentals, includes various experiences in their application, and introduces the important methods and techniques of engineering practice

The educational objectives of the program leading to the degree
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering
are that:
Within a few years of graduation, a majority of our graduates will have completed or be progressing through top graduate programs; advancing in leadership tracks in industry, non-profit organizations, or the public sector; or pursuing entrepreneurial ventures
 In these roles they will: (1) apply a deep working knowledge or technical fundamentals in areas related to mechanical, electromechanical, and thermal systems to address needs of the customer and society; (2) develop innovative technologies and find solutions to engineering problems; (3) communicate effectively as members of multidisciplinary teams; (4) be sensitive to professional and societal contexts and committed to ethical action; (5) lead in the conception, design, and implementation of new products, processes, services, and systems

Students are urged to contact the MechE Undergraduate Office as soon as they have decided to enter mechanical engineering so that a faculty advisor may be assigned
 Students, together with their faculty advisors, plan a program that best utilizes the departmental electives and the 48 units of unrestricted electives available in the Course 2 degree program

This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
as a mechanical engineering degree

Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Course 2-A)
Course 2-A is designed for students whose academic and career goals demand greater breadth and flexibility than are allowed under the mechanical engineering program, Course 2
 To a large extent, the 2-A program allows students an opportunity to tailor a curriculum to their own needs, starting from a solid mechanical engineering base
 The program combines a rigorous grounding in core mechanical engineering topics with an individualized course of study focused on a second area that the student designs with the help and approval of the 2-A faculty advisor
 The program leads to the degree Bachelor of Science in Engineering

This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET as an engineering degree

The educational objectives of the program leading to the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Engineering
are that:
Within a few years of graduation, a majority of our graduates will have completed or be progressing through top graduate programs; advancing in leadership tracks in industry, non-profit organizations, or the public sector; or pursuing entrepreneurial ventures
 In these roles they will: (1) apply a deep working knowledge or technical fundamentals in areas related to mechanical, electromechanical, and thermal systems to address needs of the customer and society; (2) develop innovative technologies and find solutions to engineering problems; (3) communicate effectively as members of multidisciplinary teams; (4) be sensitive to professional and societal contexts and committed to ethical action; (5) lead in the conception, design, and implementation of new products, processes, services, and systems

A significant part of the 2-A curriculum consists of electives chosen by the student to provide in-depth study of a field of the student's choosing
 A wide variety of popular concentrations are possible in which well-selected academic subjects complement a foundation in mechanical engineering and general Institute requirements
 Some examples of potential concentrations include robotics, engineering management, product development, biomedical engineering and pre-medicine, energy conversion engineering, sustainable development, architecture and building technology, and any of the seven departmental focus areas mentioned above
 The MechE faculty have developed specific recommendations in some of these areas; details are available from the MechE Undergraduate Office and on the departmental website

Concentrations are not limited to those listed above
 Students are encouraged to design and propose technically oriented concentrations that reflect their own needs and those of society

The student's overall program must contain a total of at least one and one-half years of engineering content (150 units) appropriate to the student's field of study
 The required core and second-level subjects include approximately 78 units of engineering topics
 The self-designed concentration must include at least 72 more units of engineering topics
 While engineering topics are usually covered through engineering subjects, subjects outside the School of Engineering may provide material essential to the engineering program of some concentrations
 For example, management subjects usually form an essential part of an engineering management concentration
 In all cases, the relationship of concentration subjects to the particular theme of the concentration must be obvious

To pursue the 2-A degree, students must submit the online 2-A enrollment form no later than Add Date of their second term in the program

Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Ocean Engineering (Course 2-OE)

The Master of Engineering in Manufacturing degree is a 12-month professional degree intended to prepare students for technical leadership in the manufacturing industries

The Mechanical Engineer's and Naval Engineer's degrees offer preparation for a career in advanced engineering practice through a program of advanced coursework that goes well beyond the master's level
 These degrees are not a stepping stone to the PhD

The Doctor of Philosophy (or Science), the highest academic degree offered, is awarded upon the completion of a program of advanced study and significant original research, design, or development

Admission Requirements for Graduate Study
Applications to the mechanical engineering graduate program are accepted from persons who have completed, or will have completed by the time they arrive, a bachelor's degree if they are applying for a master's degree, or a master's degree if they are applying for a PhD
 Most incoming students have a degree in mechanical engineering or ocean engineering, or some related branch of engineering
 The department's admission criteria are not specific, however, and capable students with backgrounds in different branches of engineering or in science may gain entry
 Nevertheless, to qualify for a graduate degree, the candidate is expected to have had at least an undergraduate-level exposure to the core subject areas in mechanical engineering (applied mechanics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, materials, control systems, and design) and to be familiar with basic electrical circuits and electromagnetic field theory

Applications for September entry are due on December 15 of the previous year and decisions are reported in March
 International students applying from abroad may be admitted, but they will be allowed to register only if they have full financial support for the first year

All applicants to the graduate program in mechanical engineering must submit the GRE test results
 International students whose native language is not English are required to take either the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam and receive a minimum score of 7 or the TOEFL exam with a minimum acceptable score of 577 (PBT), 233 (CBT) or 100 (iBT)

Early Admission to Master's Degree Programs in Mechanical Engineering
At the end of the junior year, extraordinarily qualified students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering will be invited to apply for early admission to the graduate program
 Students who are admitted will then be able to enroll in core graduate subjects during the senior year and to find a faculty advisor who is willing to start and supervise research for the master's thesis while the student is still in the senior year
 With the consent of the faculty advisor, the student may also use a portion of the work conducted towards the master's thesis in the senior undergraduate year to satisfy the requirements of the bachelor's thesis

Writing Ability Requirement
The Mechanical Engineering Department requires that all incoming graduate students demonstrate satisfactory English writing ability, or successfully complete appropriate training in writing
 This requirement reflects the faculty's conviction that writing is an essential skill for all engineers
 All incoming graduate students, native as well as international, must take the departmental writing ability test, which is administered online in June
 Depending on the results, a student will either pass or be required to take a short course during the
Independent Activities Period (IAP)
in January

Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering
To qualify for the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, a student must complete at least 72 credits of coursework, not including thesis
 Of these, at least 48 must be graduate subjects (refer to the
Guide to Graduate Study [PDF]
on the MechE website)
 The remainder of the 72 units may include advanced undergraduate subjects that are not requirements in the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum

At least three of the graduate subjects must be taken in mechanical engineering sciences (refer to the
Guide to Graduate Study [PDF]
on the MechE website)
 Students must take at least one graduate mathematics subject (12 units) offered by the MIT Mathematics Department
 For the Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering, see also the requirements listed in the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

Finally, a thesis is required
 The thesis is an original work of research, development, or design, performed under the supervision of a faculty or research staff member, and is a major part of any graduate program in the Mechanical Engineering Department
 A master's student usually spends as much time on thesis work as on coursework
 A master's degree usually takes about one and one-half to two years to complete

Master of Science in Ocean Engineering/Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering/Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering
The requirements for each of these three degrees are that the student takes 72 credit units of graduate subjects and complete a thesis

At least three of the subjects must be chosen from a prescribed list of ocean engineering subjects (refer to the
Guide to Graduate Study [PDF]
on the MechE website)
 Students must also take at least one graduate mathematics subject (12 units) offered by MIT's Mathematics Department
 For the Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering, see also the requirements listed under the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

The required thesis is an original work of research, development, or design, conducted under the supervision of a faculty or senior research staff member
 The thesis usually takes between one and two years to complete

Master of Engineering in Advanced Manufacturing and Design
The
Master of Engineering in Advanced Manufacturing and Design
is a 12-month professional degree in mechanical engineering that is intended to prepare the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the manufacturing industries
 The degree is aimed at practitioners who will use this knowledge to become leaders in existing, as well emerging, manufacturing companies
 To qualify for this degree, a student must complete a highly integrated set of subjects and projects that cover the process, product, system, and business aspects of manufacturing, totaling 90 units, plus complete a group-based thesis project with a manufacturing industry
 While centered in engineering and firmly grounded in the engineering sciences, this degree program considers the entire enterprise of manufacturing
 Students will gain both a broad understanding of the many facets of manufacturing and a knowledge of manufacturing fundamentals from which to build new technologies and businesses
 The admission process is identical to that of the Master of Science degree, with the exception that two additional essay questions are required

Learners who earn an
MITx Principles of Manufacturing MicroMasters Credential
may apply to the Advanced Manufacturing and Design program and, upon acceptance, would be credited 48 units of advanced standing credit (equivalent to approximately one-third of the full degree program and one semester on campus)

Mechanical Engineer's Degree
The Mechanical Engineer's degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond the master's level for those who wish to enter engineering practice rather than research
 This degree emphasizes breadth of knowledge in mechanical engineering and its economic and social implications, and is quite distinct from the PhD, which emphasizes depth and originality of research

The engineer's degree requires a broad program of advanced coursework in mechanical engineering totaling at least 162 credit units (typically about 14 subjects), including those taken during the master's degree program
 The engineer's degree program is centered around the application of engineering principles to advanced engineering problems and includes a Mechanical Engineering examination and an applications-oriented thesis, which may be an extension of a suitable master's thesis
 An engineer's degree typically requires at least one year of study beyond the master's degree

Naval Engineer's Degree—Program in Naval Construction and Engineering
The Naval Construction and Engineering (NVE) program provides US Navy and US Coast Guard officers, foreign naval officers, and civilian students interested in ships and ship design a broad graduate-level education for a career as a naval engineer

The program leads to the Naval Engineer's degree, which requires a higher level of professional competence and broader range of knowledge than is required for the degree of Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering or Ocean Engineering
 Subjects in the areas of economics, industrial management, and public policy and law, and at least 12 units of comprehensive design are required, in addition to an in-depth curriculum that includes naval architecture, hydrodynamics, ship structures, materials science, and power and propulsion
 The program is appropriate for naval officers and civilians who plan to participate in the design and construction of naval ships, as well as those interested in commercial ship design

For students working toward a simultaneous Naval Engineer's degree and a master's degree, a single thesis is generally acceptable, provided it is appropriate to the specifications of both degrees, demonstrating an educational maturity expected of the Naval Engineer's degree

Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science
The highest academic degree is the Doctor of Science, or Doctor of Philosophy (the two differ only in name)
 This degree is awarded upon the completion of a program of advanced study, and the performance of significant original research, design, or development
 Doctoral degrees are offered in all areas represented by the department's faculty

Students become candidates for the doctorate by passing the doctoral qualifying examinations
 The doctoral program includes a major program of advanced study in the student's principal area of interest, and a minor program of study in a different field
 The MechE Graduate Office should be consulted about the deadline for passing the qualifying exam

The principal component of the program is the thesis
 The thesis is a major, original work that makes a significant research, development, or design contribution in its field
 The thesis and the program of study are done under a faculty supervisor and a doctoral committee selected by the student and his or her supervisor, and perhaps other interested faculty members
 The committee makes an annual examination of the candidate's progress and makes a final recommendation for a public defense of the work
 The doctoral program typically requires three years of work beyond the master's degree, although this time is strongly topic dependent

Interdisciplinary Programs
Graduate students registered in the Department of Mechanical Engineering may elect to participate in interdisciplinary programs of study

Computational Science and Engineering
The
Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)

The
Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE PhD)
allows students to specialize at the doctoral level in a computation-related field of their choice through focused coursework and a thesis through one of the participating host departments in the School of Engineering or School of Science
 The program is administered jointly by the Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE) and the host departments; the emphasis of thesis research activities is the development of new computational methods and/or the innovative application of computational techniques to important problems in engineering and science

For more information,
see the program descriptions
under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs

Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
The
Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
is intended for students whose primary career objective is oceanography or oceanographic engineering
 Students divide their academic and research efforts between the campuses of MIT and WHOI
 Joint Program students are assigned an MIT faculty member as academic advisor; thesis research may be supervised by MIT or WHOI faculty
 While in residence at MIT, students follow a program similar to that of other students in their home department
 The
program is described in more detail
under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs

Leaders for Global Operations
The 24-month
Leaders for Global Operations (LGO)
program
combines
graduate degrees in engineering and management for those with
previous postgraduate
work experience
and strong undergraduate degrees in a technical field


During the two-year program, students complete a six-month internship
at one of LGO's partner companies, where
they conduct
research that
forms the basis of
a dual-degree thesis
 Students finish the program with two MIT degrees: an MBA (or SM in management) and an SM from one of seven engineering programs, some of which have optional or required LGO tracks

After graduation, alumni
lead strategic initiatives in high-tech, operations, and manufacturing companies

Polymers and Soft Matter
The
Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM)
offers students from participating departments an interdisciplinary core curriculum in polymer science and engineering, exposure to the broader polymer community through seminars, contact with visitors from industry and academia, and interdepartmental collaboration while working towards a PhD or ScD degree

Research opportunities include functional polymers, controlled drug delivery, nanostructured polymers, polymers at interfaces, biomaterials, molecular modeling, polymer synthesis, biomimetic materials, polymer mechanics and rheology, self-assembly, and polymers in energy
 The
program is described in more detail
under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs

Technology and Policy
The Master of Science in Technology and Policy is an engineering research degree with a strong focus on the role of technology in policy analysis and formulation
 The
Technology and Policy Program (TPP)
curriculum provides a solid grounding in technology and policy by combining advanced subjects in the student's chosen technical field with courses in economics, politics, quantitative methods, and social science
 Many students combine TPP's curriculum with complementary subjects to obtain dual degrees in TPP and either a specialized branch of engineering or an applied social science such as political science or urban studies and planning
 See the
program description
under the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society

Financial Support
The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers three types of financial assistance to graduate students: research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and fellowships

The majority of students in the department are supported by research assistantships (RAs), which are appointments to work on particular research projects with particular faculty members
 Faculty members procure research grants for various projects and hire graduate students to carry out the research
 The research is almost invariably structured so that it becomes the student's thesis
 An RA appointment provides a full-tuition scholarship (i
e
, covers all tuition) plus a salary that is adequate for a single person
 The financial details are outlined in a separate handout available from the MechE Graduate Office
 An RA may register for a maximum of 24 units (about two subjects) of classroom subjects per regular term and 12 units in the summer term, and must do at least the equivalent of 24 units of thesis (i
e
, research on the project) per term
 (Please note that Master of Engineering in Manufacturing students are not eligible for RA or TA positions since their subject credits exceed these limits
)
Teaching assistants (TAs) are appointed to work on specific subjects of instruction
 As the name implies, they usually assist a faculty member in teaching, often grading homework problems and tutoring students
 In the Mechanical Engineering Department, TAs are very seldom used for regular full-time classroom teaching
 Full-time TAs are limited to 24 units of credit per regular term, including both classroom subjects and thesis
 The TA appointment does not usually extend through the summer

A fellowship provides the student with a direct grant, and leaves the student open to select his or her own research project and supervisor
 A limited number of awards and scholarships are available to graduate students directly through the department
 A number of students are also supported by fellowships from outside agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, and Department of Defense
 Scholarships are awarded each year by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers
 These awards are normally granted to applicants whose interest is focused on naval architecture and marine engineering or on ocean engineering
 Applications are made directly to the granting agency, and inquiries for the fall term should be made in the preceding fall term

Prospective students are invited to communicate with the Department regarding any of these educational and financial opportunities

Experience has shown that the optimum graduate program consists of about equal measures of coursework and research, consistent with an RA appointment
 The main advantage of a fellowship is a greater freedom in choosing a research project and supervisor
 A teaching assistantship gives the student teaching experience and can also be extremely valuable for reviewing basic subject material—for example, in preparation for the doctoral qualifying exams
 It does not, however, leave much time for thesis research and may extend the time that the student needs to complete his or her degree
