Mechanical engineering is a broad and diverse field with multiple areas of specialization, so it's essential to be specific about your interests within the discipline
 To boost your college applications, you could consider becoming involved in some of MIT's specialized undergraduate programs like
1) Mechanical Engineering Design (MED), where you can develop practical skills by working on design projects, or
2) Engineering Practice Experience (EPE), which offers experiential learning and prepares students for a successful career
 Participating in these programs demonstrates your commitment to mechanical engineering and provides tangible experiences that colleges would value during admissions review
 Furthermore, you could look into MIT's undergraduate research opportunities like "Undergraduate Research in Mechanical Engineering" (UR) or "Undergraduate Research in Mechanical Engineering" (URG)
 These programs offer the chance to work on a real-world mechanical engineering problem alongside faculty members
 Lastly, consider attending conferences and seminars related to mechatronics, which combines mechanics with electronics and computer science
 This could help you understand your field better and highlight your specific interest when applying for college admissions
